The School of Computer Science is currently developing a project called CataComb, which is a Cloud-Huffman-based private safe aimed at enhancing data security for users. In an age where technology is ubiquitous and smart systems are easily accessible, the risk of sensitive data being retrieved by unauthorized individuals is a significant concern. CataComb addresses this issue by allowing users to securely store various types of data—such as photos, documents, music files, and passwords—on a website that is accessible only to them.

The project emphasizes the importance of data encryption to prevent security breaches, acknowledging that data is increasingly recognized as a valuable asset. With numerous solutions emerging in the market, including app locks and authenticators that utilize biometrics like fingerprints and facial recognition, the need for robust data protection is paramount. These advancements in technology not only enhance user convenience but also contribute to a decline in data breaches, thereby increasing the overall security of stored information.

The team behind CataComb—comprising Kirtika Puniani, Saumya Purohit, Shrestha Jaiswal, and Deepak Varshney—are students pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) with a specialization in Cloud Computing and Virtualization Technology. They have integrated a dual-layer security approach in their project, utilizing cloud technology for double authentication and implementing Huffman coding as an additional layer of data security. This innovative approach allows users to access their data securely from anywhere in the world.

In conclusion, CataComb represents a significant advancement in the field of data security, combining modern authentication methods with sophisticated data structures and algorithms to provide a comprehensive solution for safeguarding sensitive information.
