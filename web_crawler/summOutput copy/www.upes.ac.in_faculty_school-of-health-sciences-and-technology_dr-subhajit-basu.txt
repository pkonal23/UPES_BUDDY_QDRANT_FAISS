Dr. Subhajit Basu is an accomplished environmental microbiologist specializing in aquatic/marine microbiology and biogeochemistry. His research focuses on complex microbial interactions in diverse and extreme environments, emphasizing microbial ecophysiology, nutrient cycling, and the potential of microbial metabolites for societal benefits. He has a Masterâ€™s degree in Microbiology from Bangalore University and a PhD in Microbiology from Goa University, where he investigated the microbial ecology of phytoplankton blooms in the Arabian Sea and their biogeochemical implications.

Throughout his career, Dr. Basu has participated in significant international collaborative projects, including the Indo-US project on climate change impacts on the Arabian Sea ecosystem and ISRO-funded projects on oceanic harmful algal blooms. He has published extensively in leading journals and presented his findings at numerous conferences globally. His notable publications include:

1. Gledhill M, Basu S, Shaked Y (2020) "Metallophones associated with Trichodesmium erythraeum colonies from the Gulf of Aqaba." *Metallomics*, 11: 1547-1557.

Dr. Basu has held various prestigious positions, including Scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Marine Microbiology in Germany (2020-2022) and post-doctoral researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (2014-2020). He is currently an Associate Professor at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) in Dehradun, where he leads research on the microbial ecophysiology of high-altitude Himalayan ecosystems and supervises four PhD students.

His teaching philosophy emphasizes interactive learning, aiming to simplify complex concepts in planetary biogeochemistry to foster student curiosity and engagement in scientific research. He has mentored approximately ten undergraduate students and two master's students throughout his career.

Dr. Basu is actively involved in scholarly activities, serving as a review editor for several journals, including *Frontiers in Microbiology* and *Scientific Reports*. He is a member of the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) and the Geological Society of India (GSI).
