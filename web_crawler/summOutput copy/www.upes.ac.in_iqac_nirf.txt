The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) serves as a systematic approach to classify educational institutions throughout the nation. It encompasses a comprehensive set of criteria that evaluates various aspects of institutions, such as "teaching, learning, and resources," "research and professional practices," "graduation outcomes," "outreach and inclusivity," and "perception."

The NIRF was officially approved by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and was launched by the honorable minister on September 29, 2015. This framework aims to provide a transparent and standardized method for assessing the quality and performance of educational institutions across India.

Key components of the NIRF include eligibility criteria for participation, the ranking methodology, and the expected outcomes from the rankings. The framework is designed to help institutions identify areas for improvement and enhance their overall educational standards.

For more information or inquiries, institutions can refer to the NIRF's official resources or contact the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) associated with their respective institutions.
