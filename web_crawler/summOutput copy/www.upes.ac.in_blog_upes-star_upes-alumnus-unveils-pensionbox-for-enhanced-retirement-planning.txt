**PensionBox: Transforming Retirement Planning in India**
Founded by UPES alumnus Kuldeep Parashar in 2021, PensionBox is a groundbreaking digital pension platform designed to address the pressing retirement and pension issues faced by non-government workers in India. Kuldeep emphasizes that the platform aims to empower individuals to secure financial independence during their vulnerable years. The startup's innovative approach allows users to create customized pension plans swiftly, track existing savings, and invest in government-regulated pension products for tax benefits.

PensionBox has gained notable traction, having attracted $260,000 in pre-seed funding from prominent investors, including 100x.VC and Kishore Ganji, and has successfully amassed over 160,000 users through partnerships with various HR tech firms and employers across India. The startup recently showcased its potential by securing 2 crores in funding during the Amazon Prime Video startup reality series “Mission Start Ab,” where it was recognized as the top performer.

Kuldeep's journey began with the realization that many Indians, including his own parents, lacked adequate retirement plans. This inspired him to co-found PensionBox with his brother, Shivam Parashar. The platform is positioned to make a significant impact in a country where the elderly population is projected to reach 340 million by 2050, often without sufficient savings.

**Support and Incubation at UPES**
PensionBox credits its growth to the support from the UPES incubation program, Runway, which has nurtured over 200 startups across various sectors, including Fintech and Healthcare. This program has been instrumental in providing grants and resources for innovative enterprises.
