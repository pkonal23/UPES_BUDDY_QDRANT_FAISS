Dr. Debashis Majumder and Professor Vibhakar Saxena are associated with a project that involves the concept design of the Boat Friskyz Headphone. Vibhakar Saxena, a student in the Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) program specializing in Transportation & Mobility Design, is part of the 2019-2023 academic batch. 

The project is centered on design research and development, focusing on the well-known Boat headphone brand. The primary objective was to leverage research data to generate insights and develop innovative headphone designs. The Boat Friskyz headphone concept specifically addresses the problem of wire stretching shock, which is a common issue with headphones. This design integrates a degree of stretchability, effectively reducing the adverse effects of shocks on the headphone wires, thereby enhancing durability and user experience. 

The project showcases the intersection of creativity and functionality in product design, aiming to improve the reliability of headphone use.
