The Power Sector Skill Council (PSSC) is an initiative supported by the Ministry of Power (MoP), the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), and the Indian Electrical & Electronics Manufacturers Association (IEEMA). This council, with backing from the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), aims to enhance skill development within the Power Industry, which encompasses various sectors such as Power Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Renewable Energy, and Power Equipment Manufacturing.

PSSC is dedicated to achieving its objectives through active engagement with industry stakeholders, thereby ensuring that the training and skills provided are aligned with industry needs. The council collaborates with educational institutions to prepare students for careers in the power sector, offering programs like B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering, M.Tech. in Energy Systems, and MBA in Power Management. This collaboration is designed to make students industry-ready, equipping them with the necessary skills and certifications to thrive in a competitive job market.

Additionally, PSSC facilitates a framework for consultative policy dialogue and business research, which includes faculty training, student internships, and research opportunities. The partnership between PSSC and the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) allows students to receive skill certification recognized by the National Skill Development Council, further enhancing their employability in the power sector.
