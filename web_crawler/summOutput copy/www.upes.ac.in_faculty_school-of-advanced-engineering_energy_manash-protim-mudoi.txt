Mr. Manash Protim Mudoi is an esteemed faculty member with a strong background in polymer composite materials, unconventional energy, and environmental science and engineering. He has collaborated with IIT Kharagpur on research projects focused on shale gas, coal bed methane (CBM), and CO2 sequestration to enhance gas recovery. Currently, he is actively involved with the chemical engineering lab at IIT Roorkee, where he is developing natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites and nanocomposite materials. Mr. Mudoi has successfully led multidisciplinary student research initiatives, including the SEED project, and has established an experimental setup at the chemical engineering laboratory at UPES for composite development.

In addition to his research activities, Mr. Mudoi holds editorial roles in reputable journals such as Materials Today: Proceedings and SSRN, both published by Elsevier USA. He was also a Co-Convener for the Energy Summit-2022 held at UPES Dehradun.

His research interests encompass the synthesis and characterization of polymer composites, thermal degradation and mechanical failure analysis, modeling and simulation of industrial processes, and the analysis of adsorption and absorption phenomena in porous materials, with a strong emphasis on sustainable material development.

Prior to his tenure at UPES, Mr. Mudoi accumulated nearly a decade of experience in the oil and gas industry, working with notable organizations including Triune Energy Services Limited, Petrofac, and CH2M Hill Limited. His expertise extends to mechanical and thermal analysis of composite materials, adsorption phenomena in coal bed methane and shale gas, and environmentally sustainable practices.

Mr. Mudoi can be reached via email at mpmudoi@ddn.upes.ac.in. He received the SEED grant from UPES to further his research in polymer composite material synthesis and characterization.

In terms of teaching, Mr. Mudoi emphasizes creating a conducive learning environment and actively engages students through a "flipped classroom" approach, integrating project-based learning where students tackle real-world problems collaboratively. He has taught various courses including Process Equipment Design, Process Design and Flow Sheeting, Plant Utilities, Advanced Thermodynamics, Oil and Gas Software, Chemical Process Safety, and Optimization Techniques.
