The article, authored by Dr. Divya Rawat, an Assistant Professor at the UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology, discusses the popular diet trend of intermittent fasting (IF), which has gained traction for its potential health benefits and role in promoting longevity. Published on July 1, 2022, the piece outlines both the advantages and risks associated with intermittent fasting.

Intermittent fasting is characterized by timed periods of fasting, which can facilitate weight loss. The two primary forms of this diet include the 6:1 diet (fasting for one day a week) and the 5:2 diet (fasting for two non-consecutive days per week). This dietary pattern has become increasingly popular, being the most cited diet in 2020.

The article emphasizes that intermittent fasting may extend lifespan by engaging mechanisms like the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway and the circadian clock. It suggests that IF is generally safe and does not lead to energy level disturbances or increased disordered eating behaviors. Additionally, research indicates that intermittent fasting can enhance levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is linked to improved cognitive and mental health outcomes.

However, the article also highlights the potential risks of intermittent fasting, which include hypoglycemia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, hypotension, insomnia, nausea, headaches or migraines, syncope, dyspepsia, malnutrition, and excessive hunger. It underscores the need for individuals to consult healthcare professionals to determine the most suitable dietary approach for their unique bodies.

Dr. Rawat notes that fasting has historical roots, having been used as a medical treatment in ancient times and still being utilized in modern medical practices. Given the contemporary lifestyle changes that have led to reduced physical activity, intermittent fasting offers a practical solution for achieving caloric balance either through increased physical activity or dietary modifications.

The article concludes by referencing a 2021 study by Krista A et al., which found that intermittent fasting is a safe dietary therapy capable of inducing significant weight loss (greater than 5%) and improving various metabolic health markers in individuals with obesity, diabetes, inflammation, cancer, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. It also notes the dietary pattern's favorable effects on glucose control and mental health.
