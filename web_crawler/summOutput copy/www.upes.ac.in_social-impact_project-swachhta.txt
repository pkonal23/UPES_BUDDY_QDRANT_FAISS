Project Swachhta is an initiative aligned with the Swachh Bharat Mission, focusing on improving cleanliness in urban and rural areas, including streets and public spaces. In Dehradun, this project has successfully fostered a sense of responsibility among residents, encouraging their active participation in cleanliness drives conducted regularly near the campus. The program aims to engage local residents and instill a strong value of cleanliness, particularly among the youth, through voluntary work. This approach is designed to elevate the overall impact of the cleanliness initiative in the community.
