The M.Sc. programs offered by the School of Health Science and Technology at UPES provide specialized education in two key fields: Nutrition & Dietetics and Microbiology. Each program is designed to equip students with comprehensive knowledge and skills to excel in their respective careers.

### M.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics
This program allows students to specialize in two areas: **Dietetics and Holistic Wellness** and **Nutraceutical and Nutritional Policy**. The Dietetics and Holistic Wellness specialization focuses on applying nutrition principles to promote health and well-being. Students learn about clinical nutrition, therapeutic diets, sports nutrition, and lifestyle management. Conversely, the Nutraceutical and Nutritional Policy specialization explores nutraceuticals, functional foods, and their regulatory frameworks, preparing students to assist in formulating nutrition-related policies.

**Eligibility Criteria**: To qualify for the M.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics, candidates must have a minimum of 50% marks in their X and XII exams and hold a Bachelor's degree in relevant fields such as Biology, Biotechnology, Food Science, Nursing, or equivalent.

**Career Opportunities**: Graduates can pursue various roles, including clinical dietitians, nutrition consultants, research scientists, community nutritionists, and educators in settings such as hospitals, wellness centers, food industries, and government organizations.

### M.Sc. in Microbiology
This program offers specializations in **Food & Environmental Microbiology** and **Medical & Pharmaceutical Microbiology**. The Food & Environmental Microbiology specialization focuses on microorganisms in food processing and their environmental impacts, while the Medical & Pharmaceutical Microbiology specialization emphasizes microorganisms' roles in human health and medicine.

**Eligibility Criteria**: Prospective students need to have a minimum of 50% marks in their X and XII exams and a Bachelor's degree in relevant disciplines, similar to those required for Nutrition & Dietetics.

**Career Opportunities**: Graduates can find employment as microbiologists, research associates, quality control officers, and lab managers in pharmaceutical companies, healthcare institutions, biotechnology firms, forensic labs, and academia.

### Program Structure and Features
Both programs emphasize a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical training, including internships and research projects. This approach prepares students for successful careers by developing critical thinking, analytical skills, and hands-on experience in their fields.
