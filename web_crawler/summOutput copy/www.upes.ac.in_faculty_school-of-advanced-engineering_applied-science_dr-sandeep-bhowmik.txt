Dr. Sandeep Bhowmik is an accomplished Experimental High Energy Physicist currently engaged in research at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland. His academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Physics Honours from the University of Calcutta, followed by an M.Sc. from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati. He pursued his Ph.D. work at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai and Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, focusing on particle physics.

From 2009 to 2016, Dr. Bhowmik's research was centered around dark matter searches associated with top quarks, as well as the performance assessment of the CMS outer barrel hadron calorimeter (HO) using cosmic data, where he developed a noise filter. He also contributed to measuring hadronic event shape variables in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) interactions and participated in searches for single top quark production in association with a Z boson.

Between 2016 and 2017, he served as an Assistant Professor and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Visva-Bharati University. From 2017 to 2022, he held a faculty position and was the Level-3 convenor of the L1 Eg-Tau Trigger of the CMS detector, where he optimized, calibrated, and studied the isolation and performance of the CMS Level-1 tau trigger for Run2 and Run3. He is currently involved in validating reconstructed muons and furthering his research interests, which include ttH production with Higgs decaying to tau leptons and di-Higgs production in decay to multi-lepton channels.

Dr. Bhowmik has received substantial recognition for his work, including the Mobilitas Pluss postdoctoral researcher grant of €84,000 awarded by the Estonian Research Council for the period 2019 to 2021. He has also been awarded travel grants to participate in the CMS experiment at CERN 17 times, with a total stay of two years, supported by various institutions including the Government of India and the Estonian and Spanish governments.

He has contributed to over 950 publications within the CMS Collaboration, amassing over 44,000 citations, with an h-index exceeding 97 and an i10-index surpassing 700. His scholarly activities have included attending 26 conferences/workshops, with 12 presentations, three of which were delivered abroad.

Dr. Bhowmik's teaching philosophy emphasizes interactive learning, real-time feedback, and the importance of emotional support from teachers, particularly in diverse and economically varied contexts like India. He believes that teaching is not only about imparting knowledge but also a platform for mutual understanding and growth.

Currently, he is associated with the UPES – University of Petroleum and Energy Studies in Dehradun, India, teaching Engineering Physics from January to May 2025.
