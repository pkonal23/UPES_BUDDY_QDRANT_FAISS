The School of Design at UPES, under the guidance of Tanisha Kaura, is committed to enhancing student mobility through its Department of International Affairs (DIA). The DIA emphasizes the importance of international exposure for personal growth, equipping students with the skills needed to navigate various challenges. The UPES Global Mobility Desk offers world-class services that support students on their global journeys, fostering confidence and worldly knowledge essential in today's dynamic environment.

UPES has established collaborations with over 50 top-ranking universities worldwide, including institutions in the UK, Germany, Australia, Canada, and the US. This extensive network allows for exceptional exchange opportunities, ensuring that academic programs are synchronized with partner universities to prevent redundancy in coursework. Students who successfully complete their studies at these partner universities, meeting all academic requirements, receive degrees from the international institutions.

The Global Pathway Program at UPES allows students to undertake part of their courses at UPES and complete the remainder at partner universities, provided they meet eligibility criteria. This initiative aims to provide every student and staff member with opportunities for international exposure through various means, including hosting international faculty, promoting online collaborations, and engaging in joint research initiatives.

UPES also offers Student and Faculty Exchange programs, facilitating exchanges twice a year. The international academic office assists in the credit transfer process, enabling students to apply for post-study work visas based on the destination countryâ€™s regulations. The Semester Abroad Program allows students to immerse themselves in different academic environments, cultures, and educational systems, thereby broadening their horizons and enhancing their personal and professional growth.

Through co-teaching arrangements, UPES students benefit from learning alongside distinguished faculty from partner universities, promoting diversity in education that positively impacts their academic and social experiences. This global and inclusive educational approach prepares students for the complexities of a pluralistic society.

Additionally, UPES has partnered with the University of California (UC) Berkeley to further expand students' international exposure and study-abroad opportunities. The curriculum at UPES, combined with experiential learning and globally recognized academic practices, facilitates seamless credit transfers to prestigious international universities at an affordable cost.
