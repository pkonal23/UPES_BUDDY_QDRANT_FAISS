Darshan Gandhi is a postgraduate from the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad and has completed the General Management Programme at Harvard Business School. She is a strong advocate for inclusive design principles, emphasizing that effective design should be accessible to all.

In 2006, Darshan joined Godrej & Boyce's Interio division, where she played a pivotal role in implementing design thinking. She showcased a diverse range of products under a unified design philosophy. Her journey continued at Godrej Industries in 2008, where she designed SPACE, a prototype office aimed at fostering a youthful work culture that encourages idea exchange, innovation, and change. This initiative marked the beginning of a design-driven mindset at Godrej Consumer Products Limited (GCPL).

As the Global Head of Design at GCPL, Darshan established the GCPLDesignLab in 2009. Under her leadership, the lab applied design-led thinking to rejuvenate brands and create appealing product offerings tailored to the evolving Indian market. This initiative significantly enhanced consumer value across various categories, revitalizing brands such as Expert, aer, Cinthol, Goodknight, and BBLUNT. By utilizing design tools focused on user-centric segmentation, prototyping, and product mapping, she fostered a collaborative approach aligning with GCPL’s strategic goals.

Darshan and her team have successfully expanded this design philosophy to GCPL's brands in Africa and Indonesia. A notable achievement includes the designification of Darling, Africa’s leading hair extensions brand, which underscores the lab's commitment to inclusive design practices. GCPLDesignLab has garnered recognition, winning ‘India's Best Design Studio Award in 2017’ and ‘India’s Best Product Design Award in 2019’.
