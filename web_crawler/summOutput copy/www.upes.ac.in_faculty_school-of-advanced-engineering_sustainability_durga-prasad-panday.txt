Prof. Durga Prasad Panday is an Assistant Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering, specializing in Water Resources Engineering and Management. His extensive research interests cover a range of topics including water quantity and quality modeling, statistical modeling in water resources, hydroclimatic extremes, game theoretic techniques, conflict resolution mechanisms, and geospatial modeling using ArcGIS. He also utilizes Remote Sensing and GIS applications within the water resources sector.

With eight years of teaching experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, Prof. Panday effectively employs both physical and online teaching methodologies to enhance student learning. He integrates contemporary cases and research papers to keep his curriculum aligned with the latest engineering trends. Visual aids, such as physical models, are used to improve conceptual understanding, and he is adept with various online teaching platforms including Blackboard, Coursera, and Code Tantra. His teaching philosophy emphasizes practical thinking through the association of theoretical knowledge with live projects.

Prof. Panday teaches a broad array of civil engineering subjects, including Basic and Advanced Fluid Mechanics, Engineering and Groundwater Hydrology, Irrigation Engineering, Hydropower Engineering, and the Design of Hydraulic Structures. He also covers surveying, GIS, Transportation Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Engineering Geology, Engineering Mechanics, and Structural Analysis.

In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Prof. Panday actively contributes to the professional community by providing training for various stakeholders. He has conducted training sessions for Indian Forest Service (IFS) probationers on advanced surveying instruments in both 2022 and 2023. His research work includes conflict resolution mechanisms in water sharing, particularly through Hyper game and Metagame Analysis for the Krishna River, and he has studied the effects of climate change on hydroclimatic extremes and the relationship between geogenic and anthropogenic contaminants. He is also involved in consultancy projects related to water resources and structural engineering.

Prof. Panday's scholarly contributions extend to serving as a reviewer for esteemed journals such as Groundwater for Sustainable Development, Total Environment Research Themes, and Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology. He joined UPES after completing his M. Tech. from IIT Delhi in 2015 and has been a dedicated faculty member since then. He was awarded the GATE scholarship for his exceptional performance in the exam, achieving a 99th percentile ranking on two occasions.
