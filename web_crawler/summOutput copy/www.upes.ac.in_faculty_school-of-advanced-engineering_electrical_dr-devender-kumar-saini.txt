Dr. Devender Kumar Saini is currently an Associate Professor at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) and has a notable academic and professional background in electrical engineering. Before joining UPES, he worked for one year at NIET in Rajasthan and spent four years as a research scholar at IIT Roorkee. His research interests focus on power system planning, particularly utilizing distributed energy resources and electric vehicles to enhance resilient distribution grids.

Dr. Saini has led three groups of postgraduate students in conducting surveys to evaluate the acceptance and applicability of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the Dehradun region. His research aims to identify the necessary infrastructure development to encourage EV adoption. Additionally, he has performed experiments on high-voltage traction lines to accurately locate faults in the overhead electrification (OHE) system, which is crucial for minimizing train delays and positively impacting India's GDP.

In terms of scholarly activities, Dr. Saini was recognized as an IEEE Senior Member in 2021 and received accolades from Southern Indian Railways for his contributions to developing an algorithm for fault detection in traction systems. He also won the Best Paper Award at an IEEE international conference at NITTTR Chandigarh in November 2021.

Dr. Saini's academic contributions include teaching a variety of core electrical engineering subjects such as Network Theory, Control Systems, Power Systems, and Electrical Machines, along with multidisciplinary subjects. He advocates for incorporating blended engineering subjects like Digitized Substation, Cyber Security in Power Systems, and E-Vehicle & Energy Storage into the curriculum for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. He is also involved in mentoring Ph.D. candidates.

He holds an M.Tech. in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in System Engineering & Operation Research from IIT Roorkee (2009) and a Ph.D. focused on controller design for uncertain interval systems. With expertise in optimization, control problems, and power systems, Dr. Saini has published over 60 papers in SCI/Scopus-indexed journals and conferences. He actively participates in the IEEE community and has collaborated with organizations like TATA Power Solar and TEHRI to provide technical training on energy storage solutions and digitalizing electrical grids.

Dr. Saini's teaching philosophy emphasizes the importance of technical learning that aligns with social benefits, ensuring that students are aware of current societal needs before addressing technical and economic considerations. He is also committed to enhancing the smart grid and communication lab to adapt to evolving technologies and challenges in the field.
