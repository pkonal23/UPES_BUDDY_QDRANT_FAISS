The Department of International Affairs (DIA) at UPES, represented by Tanisha Kaura, focuses on enhancing student mobility both to and from the university. The initiative emphasizes the importance of international exposure in fostering personal growth and equipping students to face diverse challenges. The UPES Global Mobility Desk offers students world-class services during their global journey, facilitating learning through immersion in new cultures. This experience not only boosts confidence but also broadens students' understanding of global issues, which is crucial in today's rapidly changing world.

UPES has established partnerships with over 50 top-ranking universities worldwide and maintains four active associations with international bodies, thus providing numerous exchange opportunities. Notable collaborations include co-teaching arrangements with esteemed institutions such as the University of Canada West, INT Israel, UE Germany, and The University of Law in the UK. This collaboration ensures that UPES students have access to high-quality education and resources from leading scholars globally.

The university offers various programs, including a Student & Faculty Exchange program that occurs biannually and an International Credit Transfer Program, allowing students to complete part of their studies at UPES and the remainder at partner institutions in countries like the UK, Germany, Canada, or Australia. Additionally, the DIA facilitates internships and research opportunities for both UPES students and those from partner universities.

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, UPES adheres to guidelines set by the Government of India for international students. The university is committed to providing every student and staff member with opportunities for international exposure through various initiatives, including hosting international faculty, promoting online collaborations, encouraging joint research, and participating in global academic events.

A significant highlight of UPES's international efforts is its partnership with the University of California, Berkeley, which allows students to study abroad for a semester, further broadening their academic and cultural horizons.
