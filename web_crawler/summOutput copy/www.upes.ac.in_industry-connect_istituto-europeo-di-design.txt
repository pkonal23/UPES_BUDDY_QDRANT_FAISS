The UPES School of Design has established a partnership with the Istituto Europeo di Design (IED) in Italy, aimed at enhancing academic collaboration through faculty and staff exchanges that facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices. This collaboration will create opportunities for research and international student exchange, specifically designed to strengthen design knowledge and intercultural competencies on a global scale.

IED, a private higher education institution, offers a range of undergraduate, advanced, and master’s programs in fields such as Visual Arts and Communication Design. This partnership will enable UPES students to access IED’s programs at a reduced cost, promoting greater educational opportunities.

Key features of this collaboration include:
- Joint institutional activities between UPES and IED.
- Cooperation in international education projects.
- Organization of collaborative activities to expand the scope of cooperation.

This initiative is focused on enhancing the educational experience for students and faculty alike, fostering a deeper understanding of design in an international context.
