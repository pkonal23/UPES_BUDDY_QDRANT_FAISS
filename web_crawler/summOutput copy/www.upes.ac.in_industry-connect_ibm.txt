The partnership between IBM and the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has been renewed in 2022, enhancing their decade-long collaboration to create a more impactful educational experience. This renewed alliance introduces a unique industry-in-classroom model where IBM subject matter experts directly teach students, moving away from the traditional 'train the teacher' approach. 

Currently, this partnership represents the largest of its kind globally for IBM, with over 2,000 students enrolled. UPES was the pioneer in partnering with IBM more than ten years ago, co-branding 16 innovative specialized programs through the establishment of the Centre of Information Technology. Together, they have launched new Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) courses that are futuristic and aligned with industry needs. The redesigned curriculum emphasizes the acquisition of industry-relevant skills, particularly in sectors such as Open-Source Software and Open Standards, and includes live projects to enhance learning.

As part of the renewed collaboration, IBM will oversee minor projects and lead the capstone projects for students enrolled in its specializations. Additionally, the partnership includes the Innovation Centre for Education (ICE) week, which will occur on campus and aims to equip students with the skills to excel in contemporary technology and industry trends. The collaboration guarantees that 30% of the learning will involve face-to-face interactions between IBM experts and UPES students, alongside project-based learning initiatives.
