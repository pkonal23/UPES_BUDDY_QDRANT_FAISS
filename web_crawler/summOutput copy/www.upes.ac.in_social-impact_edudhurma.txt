**Social Impact Overview: EDUDHURMA**

**Project EDUDHURMA** is an initiative by UPES, which stands for "Education for Developing Humans for Righteousness and Mindful Actions." Launched with a strong commitment to social responsibility, the program encompasses four distinct projects: **Protsaahan, Utkarsh, Dronasthali, and Utthan.**

1. **Protsaahan**: Initiated in 2018, this project is designed to assist underprivileged yet meritorious students from the Purkal Youth Development Society (PYDS) Learning Academy in Dehradun. It aims to facilitate their pursuit of higher education at UPES, thereby opening doors to greater opportunities.

2. **Dronasthali**: This project focuses on the professional development of government school teachers. By enhancing their skills and teaching methodologies, Dronasthali aims to improve educational outcomes in local schools.

3. **Utthan**: This initiative promotes the application of knowledge within the local community. It seeks to optimize the use of scarce resources and enhance individual self-confidence, ultimately contributing to community development.

4. **Utkarsh**: The goal of this project is to foster overall societal progress through holistic education targeted at the most disadvantaged segments of society.

Through these initiatives, UPES has positively influenced the lives of over a hundred families, including students from underprivileged backgrounds, government teachers, and local educational institutions in Dehradun.
