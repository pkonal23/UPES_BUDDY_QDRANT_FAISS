Prof. Syed Sajid Hussain is an Assistant Professor at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), specializing in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, particularly in the area of Biomedical Imaging, which includes modalities such as MRI, Ultrasound (USG), and Echocardiography. Before joining UPES, he worked at MAILAB in South Korea, where he initially held a position as a computer vision engineer and later advanced to a team-lead role. Additionally, he served as a Research Fellow at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) while pursuing his PhD.

Prof. Syed's teaching philosophy emphasizes the importance of fostering a supportive learning environment for students. He incorporates innovative teaching strategies, including elements of "flipping the classroom." This approach involves assigning pre-reading tasks that students complete before class, followed by quizzes that assess their understanding. Instead of revisiting quiz content in class, he utilizes it as a foundation for engaging in-class assignments that apply real-world data and scenarios, promoting a transition from novice to expert thinking among students.

He teaches several elective courses, including Pattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), while also covering core subjects such as Data Structures, Image Processing, and Machine Learning with Python. His research primarily focuses on brain tumors, encompassing both primary and secondary types. He has developed software tools to assist radiologists in the detection, segmentation, and classification of brain tumors, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on image and video datasets. His contributions to the field have been recognized through various publications.

Prof. Syed has received accolades for his work, including the Best Coder award during his tenure at MAILAB, South Korea.
