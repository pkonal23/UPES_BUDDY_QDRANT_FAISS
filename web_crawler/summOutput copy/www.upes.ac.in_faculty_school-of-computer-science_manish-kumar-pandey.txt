He employs innovative teaching methods, such as "flipping the classroom," where students complete pre-reading assignments before class. This approach includes short quizzes based on the reading material, which are not repeated in class but serve as a foundation for in-class assignments involving real data and authentic problems. This method aims to enhance students' critical thinking skills and facilitate their transition from novice to expert levels of understanding.
