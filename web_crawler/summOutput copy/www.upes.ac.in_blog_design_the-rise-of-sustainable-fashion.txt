The UPES School of Design is making significant strides in the field of design education, particularly in sustainable fashion and product design. Mentored by industry experts from IBM and IKEA, UPES design students have garnered multiple accolades, including the prestigious ‘CII Young Designer Award 2022’, the D’source DIC-BHU Award from IIT Bombay, and an honourable mention at the Student Service Design Challenge 2022, which took place during Barcelona Design Week.

Sustainable fashion is highlighted as a vital movement aimed at reducing textile waste and environmental harm, presenting numerous opportunities for young professionals who are not only fashion-savvy but also environmentally conscious and socially empathetic. The industry faces significant challenges, as it is the second-largest polluter globally, responsible for 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. The throwaway culture exacerbates this issue, with a staggering 93% of used garments ending up in landfills, often taking up to 300 years to decompose. 

The UPES School of Design emphasizes the importance of practical experience, encouraging students to bridge the gap between academic learning and professional application through internships. For instance, Kavya Jayaprakash, a student on a semester exchange in France, secured a paid internship with Accenture.

The curriculum at UPES includes innovative courses such as ‘Sustainable Design Materials and Processes of the Future Fashion Industry’ and ‘Ethical Leadership in the 21st Century’, preparing students for a wide array of careers in design, including User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design. The Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) program is designed to cultivate creativity and innovation, equipping students with the skills needed to thrive in diverse and dynamic environments.

The school also encourages students to engage in creative projects, such as the initiative ‘One poster every day’, which challenges graphic design students to enhance their skills through daily practice. The focus on sustainable practices is reinforced by the example of brands like PECKD, which creates 100% compostable fashion items, and the emergence of platforms like ‘Rent the Runway’ that promote renting and reselling clothes.

For aspiring fashion stylists and designers, enrolling in a program at UPES is presented as a crucial step towards making a positive impact in the fashion industry. The school offers comprehensive guidance for students navigating their career paths, including information on specializations within the B.Des. program and the potential for pursuing a Master of Design (M.Des.) degree.
