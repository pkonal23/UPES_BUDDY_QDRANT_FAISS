Dr. Snigdha Misra is an Assistant Professor in the School of Health Sciences and Technology at UPES, with a specialized focus on Molecular Biology, Recombinant DNA Technology, Genetics and Epigenetics, Cell and Development Biology, and Biotechnology. Her research prominently utilizes Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to investigate reproductive biology, specifically examining seminal proteins and their effects on male fertility and female post-copulatory behavior.

Dr. Misra has co-authored several significant publications, including:

1. **"Identification of Drosophila-based endpoints for the assessment and understanding of xenobiotic-mediated male reproductive adversities"** published in *Toxicological Sciences* (2014), which has been referenced in OECD and EPA documents regarding risk evaluation for Dibutyl phthalate.
2. **"Exposure to endosulfan influences sperm competition in Drosophila"** in *Scientific Reports* (2014).
3. **"Functional male accessory glands and fertility in Drosophila require novel ecdysone receptors"** in *PLoS Genetics* (2017).
4. Contributions to the *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B* regarding the Drosophila seminal proteome (2020).
5. Recent investigations into the role of seminal odorant binding proteins in mating plug formation, currently under review in *Elife*.

Dr. Mishra's extensive hands-on experience includes advanced biological techniques such as Reverse Transcriptase PCR, qPCR, CRISPR-based methodologies, Western blotting, and various biochemical assays. She has developed a technique-based curriculum aimed at enhancing the educational experience in bio instrumentation and molecular biology for undergraduate and graduate students.

Before her tenure at UPES, Dr. Mishra completed her post-doctoral research at Wolfner Lab, Cornell University (2018-2021) and worked as a Research Associate at the National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health in Mumbai, India. She holds a Ph.D. from the CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research and has been recognized with various accolades, including qualifying the CSIR-National Eligibility Test for Junior Research Fellowship and GATE.

Dr. Misra emphasizes an interactive and individualized approach to learning, believing that effective education in science involves viewing the subject as a dynamic process and tailoring learning experiences to individual needs.
