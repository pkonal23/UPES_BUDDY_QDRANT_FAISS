Rohan's journey to securing admission at the prestigious Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) through the NMIMS Programs After Twelfth (NPAT) exam is both inspiring and illustrative of the dedication required for success in competitive examinations. After weeks of anticipation, Rohan was ecstatic to discover that he had achieved his goal.

To prepare effectively for the BBA entrance exams, Rohan devised a structured study plan. He focused on different subjects each week, dedicating the first two weeks to Quantitative Aptitude and Logical Reasoning, followed by strengthening his English skills and enhancing his vocabulary in the third week. He emphasized the importance of General Awareness, especially in the context of business news, which he integrated into his evening study sessions.

Rohan recognized the need for improvement after his initial mock test results were disappointing. Rather than succumbing to discouragement, he used this setback as motivation to refine his study strategy, particularly in time management and General Awareness. He allocated two hours each morning for math practice, followed by an hour for logical reasoning, and reserved evenings for English language study.

As the exam date approached, Rohan faced self-doubt but recalled the advice from his mentor that exams are as much a mental challenge as they are academic. On the day of the exam, he felt nervous yet prepared, recalling the extensive preparation he had undertaken. During the exam, he found himself in a focused state, managing to tackle each section—Quantitative Aptitude, Logical Reasoning, English Language, and General Awareness—with confidence.

Rohan's story emphasizes that preparation for entrance exams like the NPAT is not solely about hard work; it also requires strategic planning, self-belief, and adaptability. His success is a testament to the idea that with the right mindset and approach, aspiring students can achieve their academic and career goals.
