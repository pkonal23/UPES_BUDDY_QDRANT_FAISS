Nandini Chatterjee Singh is a distinguished cognitive neuroscientist serving as the Senior Project Officer at the UNESCO Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development (MGIEP) in New Delhi, India. Her work primarily focuses on the intersection of learning with literacy, emotion, and music.

Since joining UNESCO MGIEP in 2017, Nandini has been instrumental in applying neuroscience to develop courses aimed at enhancing social and emotional learning (SEL) through innovative digital pedagogies. She spearheaded the creation of the EMC2 framework, which emphasizes SEL competencies such as Empathy (E), Mindfulness (M), Compassion (C), and Critical Inquiry (C). Her efforts are directed towards designing engaging curricula that incorporate digital games and dialogues to foster SEL, alongside conducting cross-cultural research to evaluate the effectiveness of these methodologies within educational systems.

Nandini holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Pune, India. Her post-doctoral research was conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, where she investigated auditory learning mechanisms in songbirds. Notably, she established the first cognitive and neuroimaging laboratory in India at the National Brain Research Centre (NBRC). Her research at NBRC concentrated on language, literacy, and music, particularly examining neurodiversity in children with conditions such as autism and dyslexia. She developed DALI (Dyslexia Assessment for Languages of India), the first standardized tool for screening dyslexia across multiple Indian languages. Additionally, her laboratory explored how Indian ragas evoke distinct emotional responses.

Nandini Chatterjee Singh's contributions to cognitive neuroscience and education reflect her commitment to enhancing learning experiences through a deep understanding of emotional and cognitive processes.
