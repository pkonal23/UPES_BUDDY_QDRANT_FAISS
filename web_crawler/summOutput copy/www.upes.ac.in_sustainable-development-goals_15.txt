The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has actively engaged in various initiatives and policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, particularly in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), which focuses on the preservation and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Here are the major activities and policies implemented by UPES:

1. **Equitable Sharing of Genetic Resources**: UPES promotes fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources while ensuring appropriate access to these resources.

2. **Combatting Wildlife Trafficking**: The university takes urgent actions to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna, addressing both the demand and supply aspects of illegal wildlife products.

3. **Conservation of Mountain Ecosystems**: By 2030, UPES aims to ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, enhancing their capacity to provide essential benefits for sustainable development.

4. **Focus on SDG 15**: This goal emphasizes the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, aiming to combat desertification, halt land degradation, and prevent biodiversity loss. Key targets include:
   - Urgent action to reduce habitat degradation and protect threatened species.
   - Introduction of measures to combat invasive alien species affecting ecosystems by 2020.
   - Integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into planning and poverty reduction strategies by 2020.
   - Mobilization of financial resources to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems.
   - Conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems by 2020.
   - Combatting desertification and striving for a land degradation-neutral world by 2030.
   - Promotion of sustainable forest management, halting deforestation, and increasing afforestation and reforestation globally by 2020.

5. **Rural Women Technology Park**: Since 2015, UPES has empowered over 625 rural women through initiatives that include the manufacturing of environment-friendly 'woodless pencils', ICT-assisted handicrafts, and the cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants suitable for the local climate and soil. This project also provides marketing support from campus experts.

Through these initiatives, UPES is committed to fostering sustainable development and empowering local communities, particularly rural women, while addressing critical environmental issues and contributing to global sustainability goals.
