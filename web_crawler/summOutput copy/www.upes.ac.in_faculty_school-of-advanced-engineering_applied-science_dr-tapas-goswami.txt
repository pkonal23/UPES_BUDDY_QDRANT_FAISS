Dr. Tapas Goswami is a multidisciplinary researcher and Sr. Associate Professor at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES). His research focuses on the design, synthesis, and characterization of hetero-nanostructure materials, particularly their photophysical properties and applications in fluorescence nano-sensors and photocatalysis. Dr. Goswami has authored over 45 research articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and serves as a reviewer for several esteemed SCI-indexed journals. He is actively engaged in mentoring undergraduate and postgraduate students, offering summer research internships, and participating in national and international conferences to share his research findings through lectures and discussions.

Dr. Goswami completed his PhD in Physical Chemistry from IIT Kanpur in 2010, where he developed a molecular beam chamber for controlling molecular fragmentation. He then pursued postdoctoral research at Stanford University and Michigan State University, focusing on the control of photochemistry using ultrafast laser pulses and the dynamics of neutral chemical reactions. His teaching philosophy emphasizes the importance of inspiring students' creativity and critical thinking, fostering an environment that promotes active participation in scientific discussions. He adopts a student-centered teaching approach, integrating hands-on learning and real-world applications with theoretical concepts in chemistry.

His teaching expertise includes fundamental concepts of Physical Chemistry for MSc and BSc Chemistry students, covering areas such as Quantum Chemistry, Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy, Chemical Thermodynamics, and Statistical Thermodynamics. He also teaches elective courses on Atomic Structure, the Periodic Table, and Chemical Bonding, as well as Engineering Chemistry for first-year BTech students.

Dr. Goswami has received several accolades, including the NET-JRF and SRF from CSIR, India, Best Poster awards at the 9th Asian Conference on Quantum Information Science (AQIS'09) and the National Laser Symposium (NLS-08), a National Scholarship, and a remarkable 99.7 percentile in the Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineers (GATE-2005). He was also awarded an International Travel grant from the Department of Science and Technology (DST) for his oral presentation at an international conference in ACUP-2010 at National Taiwan University.
