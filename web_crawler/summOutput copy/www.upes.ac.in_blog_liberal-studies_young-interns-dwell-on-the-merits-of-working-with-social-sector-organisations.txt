The UPES School of Modern Media emphasizes the increasing demand for professionals skilled in public relations, corporate communications, and data analytics, highlighting the importance of social media proficiency for career advancement.

UPES has introduced the Srijan Social Internship program, which requires all first-year students to engage in 6-8 week internships with social sector organizations. This initiative is part of a broader educational framework designed to cultivate empathetic leadership and collaborative work experiences. The program aims to sensitize students to societal issues while preparing them for impactful careers.

She noted the invaluable practical experience gained through the internship, emphasizing skills such as multitasking and communication. Similarly, Kasturee Hajra from the School of Health Sciences is interning with the Human Health Education and Research Foundation, focusing on global health networks.
