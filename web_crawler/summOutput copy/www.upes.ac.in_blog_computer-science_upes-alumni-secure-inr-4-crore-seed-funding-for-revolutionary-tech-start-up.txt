Divyani Singh and Anshul Saxena, alumni of the UPES School of Computer Science, have proudly embarked on an entrepreneurial journey that has culminated in securing a substantial INR 4 crore seed funding for their innovative tech start-up, Cognecto. Their venture, which focuses on AI-powered solutions, aims to enhance operational efficiency in the mining and construction industries, addressing challenges such as rising costs, declining productivity, an ageing workforce, and strict environmental regulations. The funding round was led by Inflection Point Ventures (IPV), a notable investment firm.

Divyani and Anshul's journey is characterized by personal growth and development, instilling in them values of independence, resourcefulness, patience, and optimism. They credit their success to the unwavering support from their families, friends, and mentors, who encouraged them to pursue their dreams and provided essential feedback and guidance throughout their venture. Their entrepreneurial spirit was evident during their time at UPES, where Divyani took on the role of student placement coordinator, demonstrating her leadership skills by securing internships for her peers.

Their innovative solutions at Cognecto include AI-powered predictive maintenance, which helps businesses identify potential equipment issues before they lead to breakdowns, thereby minimizing repair costs and downtime. Additionally, their fleet management solution allows for real-time tracking, optimizing efficiency, while their safety solution uses AI to identify and mitigate risks, ensuring employee safety and asset protection.

The duo's journey from students specializing in Cloud Computing and Virtualization Technology from 2012 to 2016 to successful entrepreneurs is an inspiring example of how perseverance, collaboration, and innovative thinking can lead to significant achievements. Their story is a testament to the potential of UPES graduates to make impactful contributions to their fields.
