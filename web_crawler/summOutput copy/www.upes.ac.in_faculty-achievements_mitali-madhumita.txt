Mitali Madhumita, a faculty member at the School of Health Sciences & Technology, has achieved significant recognition through the publication of her research paper titled "Ultrasonic modulated rice bran protein concentrate: Induced effects on morphological, functional, rheological, and thermal characteristics" in the journal *Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies*. The paper, co-authored with Navratan Sharma, Yogesh Kumar, and Pramod K Prabhakar, provides an in-depth analysis of rice bran protein concentrate that has been treated with ultrasonication. 

The study focuses on the effects of ultrasonication on the microstructure of rice bran protein, aiming to clarify how this treatment enhances the protein's functional properties. The findings are particularly significant for the food industry and researchers, as they explore methods to improve the functional characteristics of plant proteins, which could lead to advancements in food technology.
