**Academic Background:**
Pranjali Shrikant Kulkarni has a robust interdisciplinary academic foundation, having completed her undergraduate studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in Hyderabad, followed by a Master of Science (MSc) in Cognitive Science at IIT Gandhinagar. She is currently pursuing a PhD in Cognitive and Brain Sciences at IIT Gandhinagar, focusing on linguistic meanings and their perception through the lens of Cognitive Science.

**Research Interests:**
Pranjali's research interests are deeply rooted in language and meaning, exploring the intersection of cognition and the Philosophy of Science. Her work critically examines the influence of context on linguistic meanings, advocating for a departure from traditional structuralist approaches towards a more context-driven understanding. She draws upon Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophical insights, emphasizing the relevance of subjective interpretations and embodied experiences in understanding language cognition. Future projects will delve into the implications of language processing systems in artificial intelligence, particularly concerning decision-making and ethical considerations.

**Work Experience:**
Pranjali has gained diverse research experience, including evaluating mental health initiatives with The Ratan Tata Trust, studying benefit misallocation among Scheduled Tribes, and analyzing Bharatanatyam dance movements using motion capture technology at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST). Her teaching experience includes serving as a Graduate Teaching Fellow at IIT Gandhinagar, where she led courses on Embodied Cognition and Methods of Phenomenology, and delivered guest lectures on Cognitive Linguistics, Language and the Brain, and Early Language Acquisition.

**Teaching Philosophy:**
Pranjali's teaching philosophy emphasizes interdisciplinary learning, fostering curiosity, and tailoring education to meet students' individual needs. She aims to develop students' conceptual understanding in Psychology and Cognition while equipping them with research skills to analyze concepts from multiple perspectives. Her innovative teaching strategies break down complex topics into accessible units, promoting an interactive learning environment that connects theoretical knowledge with real-world applications.

**Awards and Achievements:**
- Silver Medal for second highest score in the BASS program at TISS Hyderabad.
- Gold Medal for highest score in MSc at IIT Gandhinagar.
- Recipient of a project scholarship for the Re-inventing Japan Project under the JAIST-India Cooperative Program for frontier scientists.

**Scholarly Activities:**
Pranjali has actively participated in various academic conferences, presenting her research on second language acquisition and Wittgensteinâ€™s methodology at notable symposiums, including:
- National Seminar on Creating Safety Nets for Adolescents and Youths
- Annual Meeting of the Association for Cognitive Science
- National Symposium on Cognitive Science
- International Symposium on Bilingualism and Cognition

Her workshops and discussions on Design Interventions for Large-Scale Social Concerns and Artificial Wisdom further demonstrate her commitment to applying cognitive principles to address real-world challenges. She has also worked on optimizing assessment tools at ReMaterials Ahmedabad and analyzing machine scoring of student essays at Playpower Labs.

**Conclusion:**
Pranjali Kulkarni is a dedicated academic with a strong commitment to advancing research in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, particularly in the areas of language and cognition. Her interdisciplinary approach and emphasis on contextual understanding of linguistic meanings position her as a significant contributor to the field.
