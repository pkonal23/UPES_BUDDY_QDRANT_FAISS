Dr. Sachin Pathak is a prominent researcher and educator specializing in nano-sized ultra-thin magnetic and spin systems, including magnetic superlattices, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), and ferromagnetic nanomaterials. His research has significantly advanced the field, particularly with his 2017 work on high-density patterns achieved through ion-induced phase transformation, which demonstrated the creation of magnetic patterns approximately 8 nm in size via low-energy proton irradiation (published in *Applied Physics Letters*, 111, 152401). 

In his recent publication (*Advanced Science*, 9, 2201749, 2022), Dr. Pathak explored the unique pseudomorph interfacial structure of Co/Pd, which was developed through the phase transformation of paramagnetic Co3O4/Pd into ferromagnetic Co/Pd superlattices. This transformation, facilitated by low-energy proton irradiation, enabled the induction of significant orbital anisotropy and enhanced spin-orbit coupling at the interface, attributed to structural inversion asymmetry and substantial in-plane tensile stress.

Dr. Pathak has also contributed to the development of a cost-effective and reliable in-house method for estimating the characteristics of MTJs, as detailed in his works from 2017 (*Applied Physics Letters*, 110, 232401) and 2020 (*Nature Scientific Reports*, 10, 2799). His expertise encompasses the growth and characterization of magnetic thin films and nanostructures, as well as transport measurements. He is skilled in developing scientific instruments, such as the MOKE microscope/magnetometer (*Journal of Applied Physics*, 115, 043906, 2014), solidifying his value to the academic community.

In addition to his research, Dr. Pathak is committed to fostering student engagement and critical thinking in physics and materials science. He emphasizes creating an inclusive classroom environment that encourages exploration and discussion, aiming to inspire a lifelong interest in the subject among his students. He integrates real-world examples and interdisciplinary connections into his teaching, promoting problem-solving skills vital for success in academia and the workforce. Through personalized instruction and ongoing feedback, he aspires to help his students become self-directed learners.

Dr. Pathak completed his Ph.D. in Physics, focusing on nanomagnetic materials at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi). He then spent three years as a researcher at Yonsei University and another three years as a research professor at Korea University, enhancing his expertise in magnetic memory technology. In 2020, he joined the Department of Physics at UPES Dehradun, India, where he actively teaches and mentors students.

His accolades include the CSIR Research Fellowship at IIT Delhi, BK Plus Fellowship, and Yonsei Postdoctoral Fellowship, along with funding from UGC-DAE-CSR, DESY Germany, and Elettra Italy for his research endeavors. Dr. Pathak has published around 34 research articles in reputable SCI-indexed journals and holds two patents, showcasing his dedication to advancing the field of spintronics.
