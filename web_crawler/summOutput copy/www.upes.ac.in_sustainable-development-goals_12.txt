Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) emphasizes the importance of responsible consumption and production patterns, advocating for efficient resource use, waste reduction, and sustainable management of natural resources. It encourages the adoption of sustainable lifestyles, the establishment of circular economies, and the enhancement of awareness regarding the environmental impacts of consumption, all aimed at fostering a more sustainable and resilient global economy.

The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has implemented several major activities and policies to align with SDG 12, including:

1. **Awareness and Information Dissemination**: UPES ensures that individuals are equipped with the necessary information and awareness for sustainable development.

2. **Charitable Initiatives**: The university conducts donation drives to support less fortunate individuals.

3. **Framework Implementation**: UPES actively implements the 10-Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

4. **Chemical and Waste Management**: The university focuses on the environmentally sound management of chemicals and wastes.

5. **Support for Developing Countries**: UPES aids developing countries in enhancing their scientific and technological capacities.

In terms of infrastructure, UPES has installed solar water heating plants with a capacity of 61,500 liters and has adopted a policy to retrofit all conventional lighting on campus with energy-efficient alternatives. The university also maintains a unity power factor at its sites to ensure zero energy loss.

Additionally, UPES has developed tools aimed at monitoring sustainable development impacts in tourism. The university encourages its students to engage in innovative engineering projects that contribute to sustainability, including:

- Flying Cars
- Electric Cycles
- Waste Management Solutions
- Water Security Initiatives
- First Aid Programs
- Fire and Safety Measures
- Women Empowerment through the cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants
- Solar Driers
- Biochar Bio Briquettes

One notable student project is an anon-tracking solar tree equipped with 3-Watt and 6-Watt LED lights, multiple USB 2.0 ports, and basic electrical sockets for charging laptops and mobile phones.

UPES also promotes the adoption of sustainable practices among companies and encourages the integration of sustainability into corporate reporting. Key objectives under SDG 12 include:

- Substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, recycling, and reuse.
- Promoting sustainable public procurement practices.
- Halving global per capita food waste and reducing losses in production and supply chains.
- Achieving sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.

Overall, UPES is committed to advancing the principles of SDG 12 through its policies, initiatives, and student projects, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.
