Dr. Aditya Sharma is an Associate Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering, known for his extensive research in the areas of Swift-heavy-ion and ion-implantation. His work primarily investigates the effects of ion-irradiation on the structural, optical, magnetic, and electrical properties of various oxide materials, including HfO2, SrVO3, SnO2, CuO, and Cu2O. He aims to deepen the understanding of ion-solid interactions through his research.

Dr. Sharma holds a strong belief in the reciprocal nature of learning and teaching, stating, "In learning, one will teach, and in teaching, one will learn." He views teaching as an art form that requires clarity and a well-defined understanding of the subject matter. His foremost objective is to create an inclusive classroom environment that fosters open communication and discussion. He emphasizes the importance of practical knowledge and real-life examples to ensure concepts leave a lasting impression on students. Instead of merely imparting theoretical knowledge, he focuses on developing students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while instilling a sense of responsibility towards society through research and science.

His academic journey includes significant post-doctoral research at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in South Korea, where he worked on multi-mode research in fields such as condensed matter physics, materials science, and nanotechnology. His research projects included the degradation of water pollutants using photo-catalysts, studies on magnetism in ion-implanted thin films, white light emission from functionalized photoluminescent materials, fuel cell development for hydrogen evolution, antibacterial activity of graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide, and the development of artificial bone grafts and solar cells.

Dr. Sharma's current research interests focus on revolutionizing energy harvesting and conversion technologies, including the development of up-conversion long persistent luminescence materials, Na-ion battery/supercapacitor electrodes, and solar cells. His teaching portfolio encompasses a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, such as Basic Electronics, Engineering Physics, Modern Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Mechanics, and Synthesis and Characterization Techniques.

Before joining UPES in 2023, Dr. Sharma served as an Assistant Professor and Associate Head of the Physics Department at Manav Rachna University, where he also led the materials research group and managed the University Instrumentation Centre. He received the Best Faculty (Research) award for his contributions to research and development, securing two major projects from the Haryana State Council for Science, Innovation, and Technology (HSCSIT; DST-Haryana) amounting to 18.25 Lakhs (as Principal Investigator) and 11.95 Lakhs (as Co-Principal Investigator).

With a lifetime membership in the Materials Research Society of India, Dr. Sharma has published 65 articles and five book chapters in SCI/SCOPUS journals and actively serves as a guest editor for several international journals. He has organized numerous conferences and workshops aimed at knowledge exchange among scientists and students.

His research also involves investigating the local electronic structure of nano-dimensional materials through X-ray spectroscopy techniques, including NEXAFS, EXAFS, XPS, and X-PDF. His PhD research, conducted under the IUAC, New Delhi-sponsored project, focused on defect evolution in wide band-gap semiconductors due to SHI irradiation and ion-implantation, exploring their applications in gas sensing.

Dr. Sharma continues to be a valued contributor to the academic community, inspiring both students and fellow researchers in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology.
