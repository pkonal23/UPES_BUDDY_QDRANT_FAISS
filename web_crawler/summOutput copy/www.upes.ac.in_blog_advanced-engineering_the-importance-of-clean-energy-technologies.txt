Clean technologies encompass a range of innovative fields including recycling, renewable energy, information technology, green transportation, electric motors, green chemistry, and lighting. In particular, clean energy technology focuses on the substitution of traditional energy sources with cleaner alternatives. China has made significant strides in this area, introducing various innovations and applications that enhance clean power generation and operational technologies, thereby facilitating large-scale clean energy exploration and integration.

India is also making ambitious plans in the renewable energy sector, aiming for a capacity of 175 GW by 2022, which includes 100 GW from solar energy and 60 GW from wind energy. This emphasis on renewable energy is crucial as it is expected to be a major driver for the future energy landscape.

The National Education Policy 2020 highlights the importance of research and innovation in academia, advocating for financial support for academic research initiatives. According to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the United Nationsâ€™ International Labour Organisation (ILO), employment in the clean energy sector reached 12.7 million globally last year, with 700,000 new jobs created within a year. Career opportunities in this sector include roles such as Solar Energy Specialist, Renewable Energy Analyst, and Project Engineer.

The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has also been noteworthy, with a reported 42% increase in EV sales in India, marking a significant shift in the automotive industry. This growth is accompanied by a rising demand for professionals in clean energy fields, including bio-energy, wind power, and hydropower, as the private sector expands.

Educational programs like B.Tech in Clean Energy Technologies equip graduates with essential knowledge in solar thermal engineering, advanced material physics, and solar power technology. The future of engineering is leaning towards sustainable practices, where clean energy technologies not only provide energy solutions but also contribute to reducing environmental impacts and combating climate change.
