Mrs. Ouroz Khan is an accomplished academic and researcher in the field of psychology, specializing in cognitive science and decision-making. She holds a PhD from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, where she is currently pursuing her doctoral research under the supervision of Dr. Sumitava Mukherjee. Her research focuses on the role of magnitude in loss aversion under risk, and she has presented her findings at various prestigious national and international conferences.

In 2022, Mrs. Khan's poster titled "Finding Effective Visualization Formats to Correct the Exponential Growth Bias and Increase Support for Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions to Combat COVID-19" was showcased at the APS Annual Convention in Chicago, Illinois, and subsequently at the 31st Annual Convention of the National Association of Psychology at IIT Bombay. She also presented her work "Preference for Using Predictions from Humans over Algorithms Goes Beyond Perceived Accuracy" at the Society for Judgment and Decision Making Conference in 2022. Earlier in 2019, she presented research on "Magnitude Judgment in Numerical and Temporal Domain" at Pondicherry University during the 29th Annual Convention of NAOP.

Mrs. Khan has received several prestigious awards and grants throughout her academic career. Notably, she was awarded a Research Scholar Travel Grant from IIT Delhi, which enabled her to present at the ICPS Annual Convention 2023 in Brussels, Belgium. Additionally, she received a Travel and Accommodation Grant from the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) for a workshop at the Centre for Neuroscience, IISc, Bangalore, in 2018. In the academic year 2017-18, she was a Junior Research Fellow on a project funded by the Department of Science and Technology. Her academic accolades also include the Award of Excellence from the University of Allahabad in 2016 for her performance in Cognitive Science and a Masters Fellowship during her postgraduate studies.

Beyond her research, Mrs. Khan has worked as a research assistant at the Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Allahabad, contributing to a project focused on the "Influence of Attention on the Control of Eye Movement" using eye-tracking and EEG methodologies. She has published her research in several reputable international journals, including *Cognition* and the *Journal of Experimental Psychology*.

In January 2024, Mrs. Khan joined the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) as an Assistant Professor in the Psychology and Behaviour program at the School of Liberal Studies and Media. Prior to this role, she served as a teaching assistant during her PhD, where she aided in courses such as Introduction to Psychology, Introduction to Cognitive Science, and Cognitive Processes, and also delivered guest lectures on experimental design using PsychoPy.

Mrs. Khan advocates for an innovative learning environment that incorporates new technologies and emphasizes active learning through virtual simulations and collaborative platforms. She supports flexible curricula and self-paced learning to cater to diverse student needs, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and experiential learning. Her teaching philosophy revolves around continuous assessments and timely feedback, aiming to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills among her students.

Her research interests are primarily centered on human judgment and decision-making, particularly the psychological valuation of gains and losses. She has engaged in applied research related to magnitude and numerical cognition, including a collaboration with Berkeley Haas on understanding the exponential growth of COVID-19 and its implications for public health interventions. Additionally, she explores how visual interfaces impact the perception of quantity changes and waiting times, aiming to connect theoretical insights with practical applications.
