Dr. Vamsi Krishna Kudapa is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), Dehradun, where he has been since 2013. Prior to his tenure at UPES, he served as an Assistant Professor and Head of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Sri Aditya Engineering College in Andhra Pradesh. Dr. Krishna obtained his Ph.D. in Oil and Gas Modelling and Simulation from UPES in 2018.

His research interests are centered around resource efficiency and waste management, which he views as critical for sustainable development. His work emphasizes the judicious use of resources, environmental protection, and the enhancement of sustainable practices, particularly in the domains of Environment and Energy. Dr. Krishna has developed a unique prototype, the "Digital Oil Field," which integrates gas lift and oil-spill control mechanisms, and has successfully led a consultancy project focused on improving the characteristics of halophytic algae for wastewater treatment.

Dr. Krishna is recognized for his scholarly contributions, having received an Outstanding Award for the establishment of the Digital Oil Field setup at UPES, as well as Best Paper Awards at notable international conferences, including the Materials & Sustainable Engineering in Chemical and Allied Industry Conference (MSECAI-2022) and the Advances in Health, Safety, Fire, Environment, Allied Sciences and Engineering Conference (HSFEA 2016). His academic output includes 23 publications, 2 patents, 5 book chapters, and 1 book.

In his teaching role, Dr. Krishna instructs courses on Computational Fluid Dynamics and Unconventional Gas Reservoirs, focusing on the flow behavior of hydrocarbons and the extraction techniques from reservoirs such as Coal Bed Methane, Shale Gas, and Gas Hydrates. He emphasizes hands-on experience in his teaching philosophy, which includes innovative methods like "flipping the classroom" to enhance student engagement and learning.
