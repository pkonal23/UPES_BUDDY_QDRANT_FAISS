Muskan Handa, a final year B.Tech. (Hons.) student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Big Data at the School of Computer Science, UPES, has achieved a remarkable milestone by securing a job offer from Microsoft with an annual package of INR 50 lakh. Reflecting on her journey, Muskan emphasizes the importance of self-discipline over motivation, stating that motivation can fluctuate, but consistent daily tasks driven by discipline lead to success. 

She attributes her success to her mentors at UPES and expresses gratitude for the support from her family, particularly her mother, a teacher, and her father, a businessman. Muskan acknowledges the belief her grandparents had in her, which bolstered her confidence during challenging times. She advises young individuals to focus on personal growth rather than comparing themselves to others, emphasizing that true competition lies within oneself.

Muskanâ€™s journey was not without its challenges; she initially struggled with the pressures of college life. However, she persevered, honing her skills one at a time instead of overwhelming herself with multiple topics. Her hard work paid off during the recruitment process, where she impressed interviewers enough to be invited directly to the final interview round at Microsoft, resulting in her swift selection as a Full-time Software Development Engineer.

In her closing thoughts, Muskan encourages others not to fear external opinions and to maintain humility and discipline in their pursuits. She expresses her heartfelt appreciation for the Training and Placement Department at UPES for their role in her success.
