Sarthak Arora, as part of his involvement in the Bugcrowd program, submitted a detailed security report addressing a vulnerability found in NASA's web application. This vulnerability was identified as a "Server Security Misconfiguration" due to the missing X-Content-Type-Options HTTP response header. The absence of this header significantly heightened the application's risk to MIME type sniffing, which poses a threat of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Such attacks can compromise web application integrity by allowing the injection of malicious scripts, potentially endangering sensitive user information.

To support his findings, Sarthak employed industry-standard tools, specifically Burp Suite, to assess the vulnerability. His report included comprehensive steps for reproducing the issue, demonstrating how the lack of the X-Content-Type-Options header in HTTP responses could jeopardize web security. The identification of this vulnerability is pivotal for improving the overall security framework of NASAâ€™s web infrastructure.

The report and Sarthak's achievements are highlighted under the School of Computer Science, showcasing his contributions to enhancing cybersecurity measures.
