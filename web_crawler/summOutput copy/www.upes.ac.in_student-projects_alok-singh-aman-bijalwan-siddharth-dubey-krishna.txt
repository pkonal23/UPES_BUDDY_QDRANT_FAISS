The UPES Robotics team is currently engaged in the design and development of an innovative electric scooter at the UPES Robotics lab. This scooter is a plug-in chargeable two-wheeled transport vehicle that operates without an engine, significantly contributing to the reduction of air pollution. 

The project is being spearheaded by a group of students: Alok Singh, Aman Bijalwan, Siddharth Dubey, and Krishna, who are pursuing their B.Tech in Electronics & Computer Engineering from the 2022-26 batch, alongside their peers in the M. Tech. program in Automation and Robotics Engineering from the 2021-23 batch. 

Key features of the electric scooter include:
- Safety and environmental friendliness.
- Ease of battery repair and replacement.
- A design that emphasizes stability and durability, utilizing a scooter frame tailored for long-term use.
- The vehicle is powered by a 1000W hub motor, which is crucial for its acceleration capabilities. 

Testing is currently being conducted to evaluate the performance of different battery types for the scooter.

The project is supervised by Professor Dr. Piyush Kuchhal, who serves as the mentor for the team.
