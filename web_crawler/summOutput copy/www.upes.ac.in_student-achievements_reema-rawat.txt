A new electrochemical biosensor tool has been developed to facilitate early detection of cervical cancer, particularly the type associated with HPV-16, a significant biomarker. This innovative device is designed to be user-friendly, cost-effective, and highly accessible, making it especially beneficial for individuals in resource-limited settings. Clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness, indicating a strong potential to reduce cervical cancer mortality rates through early and non-invasive testing methods.

Reema Rawat, a PhD scholar from the Allied Health Sciences Department at the UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology, has been awarded the Natco Pharma-Sponsored Dr. Yellapragada Subba Rao FABA Young Innovator Award 2024 at the University of Hyderabad for her groundbreaking work on this portable cervical cancer screening device. This recognition comes with a cash prize of â‚¹5 lakh and highlights her contributions to improving cancer diagnostics. Reema initiated her research in 2022 under the mentorship of Dr. Ashish Mathur, a professor and project mentor for this initiative. 

This achievement not only underscores Reema's pioneering efforts in the field but also marks a significant step forward in making cancer diagnostics more accessible and effective.
