Dr. Vipin Gaur, a faculty member in the Applied Science department, has made significant contributions to the Belle and Belle II projects at the KEK (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization) in Japan. His involvement has garnered attention and support from high-ranking officials, including a visit from the Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) from New Delhi on September 28, 2022. During this visit, Prof. Gagan Mohanty from TIFR, Mumbai, provided a briefing to the DST Secretary on behalf of the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), where Dr. Gaur serves as the Institutional Representative.

Dr. Gaur's role in these international mega science and technology projects was highlighted during an earlier visit on February 9, 2020, when he was stationed at KEK by Virginia Tech, USA. At that time, the Indian Ambassador to Japan, His Excellency Mr. Sanjay Verma, along with Science & Technology Counselor Ms. Usha Dixit, met with Dr. Gaur and other Indian Principal Investigators (PIs) at KEK, showcasing the Indian government's support for the projects.

Dr. Gaur's involvement in these prestigious projects underlines UPES's commitment to advancing scientific research and collaboration on a global scale.
