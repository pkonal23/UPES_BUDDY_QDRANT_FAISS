**Dr. Atharva Rajendra Bhide's Profile Summary**

**Contact Information:**
- Email: atharvar.bhide@ddn.upes.ac.in

**Current Position:**
- Assistant Professor at the School of Health Sciences and Technology, UPES.

**Research Interests:**
Dr. Bhide specializes in dosage form design and pharmaceutical formulations, focusing on how various factors, including drug properties and patient needs, influence the development and optimization of drug delivery systems. His research also delves into the impact of regulatory frameworks and ethical considerations on the success of innovative drug delivery methods. His notable work includes the evaluation of pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and antimalarial efficacy of artemether-loaded polymeric nanorods, as well as the fabrication and evaluation of these nanorods derived from mechanically stretched nanospheres.

**Educational Background:**
- Ph.D. from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. His doctoral thesis was titled "Long-acting Polymeric Nanospheres and Nanorods for Efficient Delivery of Antimalarial Drugs." During his Ph.D., he was heavily involved in the preparation, in vitro and preclinical evaluation of long-acting nanoformulations, and the development of analytical and bioanalytical methods.

**Teaching Philosophy:**
Dr. Bhide emphasizes creating an engaging and supportive learning environment that promotes active student participation. He employs a blended learning approach, which includes pre-class assignments for reviewing key concepts and literature in pharmaceutics, assessed through quizzes. This method allows class time to be dedicated to practical, hands-on activities where students solve real-world problems and analyze actual research data, fostering a deeper understanding and application of theoretical knowledge.

**Work Experience:**
- Junior Research Fellow (JRF) on a DST-SERB funded project from 2019 to 2022, focusing on the development and characterization of long-acting polymeric nanospheres and nanorods for antimalarial drug delivery.

**Scholarly Activities:**
- Developed a sensitive RP-HPLC method for estimating artemether from polymeric nanoparticles post pre-column acid treatment using a UV-visible detector.

**Awards and Recognition:**
- Qualified the national level GPAT exam in 2017.
- Received the ‘Best Oral Presentation’ award at the 3rd National Biomedical Research Competition in 2021, organized by the Society of Young Biomedical Scientists, India.
- Honored with the ‘Best Poster Award’ on Research Scholar’s Day at BITS Pilani during his Ph.D. tenure.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Nanoparticles, Nanorods, Malaria, Long-acting formulations, Drug delivery.

Dr. Bhide is committed to enhancing the effectiveness and safety of drug delivery systems, addressing significant challenges in therapeutic development through his innovative research and teaching methodologies.
