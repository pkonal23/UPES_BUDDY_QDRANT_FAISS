To celebrate World Book Day, a painting competition was organized focusing on the theme of 'environment'. This event involved five students from government primary schools, along with their teachers and principals. The winners of the competition received trophies, while all participants were rewarded with bags, books, and stationery.

Additionally, there is a mention of "Project Bodh," although specific details regarding its eligibility criteria were not provided in the text.
