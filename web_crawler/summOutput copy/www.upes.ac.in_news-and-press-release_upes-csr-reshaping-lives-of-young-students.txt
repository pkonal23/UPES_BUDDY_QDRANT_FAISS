The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) is dedicated to making a significant impact through its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, which focus on transforming lives through education. The university aims to uplift underprivileged students, create safe learning environments, and address various societal challenges. 

One of the notable initiatives is Project Samvedna, aimed at supporting children of migrant construction workers in five government schools located in Kotra Santoor, Upper Kandoli, Doonga, Misraspatti, and Phulsani. This project includes workshops focused on raising awareness about sexual assault and harassment, ensuring the safety of students. In collaboration with Aavishkaar NGO, UPES provides educational support, daycare facilities, and mid-day meals for these children, along with school uniforms to enhance their confidence and eagerness to learn.

Additionally, UPES has implemented the SmartClass program, which enhances digital learning through multimedia content and interactive teaching aids, creating a more immersive educational experience. Another initiative, Learnshaala, aims to empower students by providing them with the necessary skills and values for holistic education. The Math Matters Program specifically targets empowering women by addressing math phobia and equipping them with strong mathematical skills and student-centric teaching practices.

UPES also runs Project Protsaahan, which offers opportunities for underprivileged students to pursue higher education. The university is recognized as one of the top private universities in India, established under the UPES Act, 2003, and has received various accolades, including a rank of 52 in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2023, and being ranked the No. 1 private university in academic reputation by QS World University Rankings 2024.
