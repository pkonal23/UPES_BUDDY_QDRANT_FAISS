Dr. Parswajit Kalita is an Assistant Professor at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), where he has been contributing since 2020. He holds a PhD in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and has also been a visiting PhD scholar at Universite Paris-Sud in France. His teaching philosophy emphasizes a 'project-based' and 'problem-based' learning approach, encouraging students to engage with real-world problems and develop innovative solutions. This methodology fosters critical thinking, creativity, and significant questioning among students.

Dr. Kalita's research interests are centered on Materials Science, particularly focusing on the radiation damage tolerance of materials pertinent to fission and fusion applications. He also explores the area of mechanical energy harvesting through the use of polymer-biowaste composites. His expertise includes studying ion irradiation-induced effects in materials, which is crucial for enhancing the performance of materials in next-generation electronics and biomedical applications, especially in the context of fission/fusion reactors and the development of battery-free self-powered devices.

He has received several prestigious awards and grants throughout his academic career, including ongoing funded research projects from the DAE-BRNS and UGC-DAE CSR of the Government of India. His accolades include the Graduate Student Award from the European Materials Research Society (E-MRS) in 2019, the Raman-Charpak Fellowship in 2017, and the Best Oral Presentation Award from the Ion Beam Society of India & IBMEC in 2018.

In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Dr. Kalita supervises two PhD students and mentors undergraduate and postgraduate students in their dissertations and theses. He teaches Physics Theory and Lab courses at UPES and is committed to fostering scholarly activities and impactful contributions in the academic field.
