Dr. Atul Kumar Patidar is a Senior Associate Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES). His academic and professional background spans over 15 years in the Petroleum Exploration industry and academia, focusing on upstream oil and gas sectors, particularly in basin analysis, 3D seismic interpretation, and deepwater depositional systems. Dr. Patidar holds a significant teaching role, having instructed various courses in programs such as B.Sc Geology (Hons), M.Sc Petroleum Geoscience, and B.Tech Applied Petroleum Engineering. His course offerings include Sedimentary and Petroleum Geology, Sedimentology, Well Site Geology and Formation Evaluation, Basin Analysis, Geomorphology, and Sedimentary & Sequence Stratigraphy.

Dr. Patidar's teaching philosophy emphasizes the cultivation of critical thinking among students, advocating for outcome-based learning through relevant pedagogical methods. He adopts a student-centric approach, employing interactive techniques and real-world examples to enhance learning. Recognizing the diverse learning paces of students, he implements remedial strategies to improve overall educational outcomes. He also values apprenticeship in education and integrates field study-based analogues into his teaching, utilizing photographs, videos, rock samples, and models.

Before his tenure at UPES, Dr. Patidar worked as an Exploration Geoscientist at Reliance Industries Limited, where he was involved in prospective analysis and exploration planning in the deep-water Cauvery Basin. Currently, he is participating in the Indian HC Appraisal Program (I-HAP) initiated by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MOPNG), aimed at reassessing the hydrocarbon potential of India's prolific basins.

His research interests are broad, encompassing 3D Seismic Interpretation & Prospect Maturation, Basin Analysis, Deepwater Geomorphology, Geological Sequestration, Tectonic Geomorphology, Neotectonics, Paleoseismology, and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). Dr. Patidar has an impressive publication record, with over 40 research papers in high-impact SCI/Scopus-indexed journals and conference proceedings.

In addition to his teaching and research, Dr. Patidar is actively involved in academic administration, serving on various committees, and coordinating the Industry-Academia Collaboration Program (ITAP) to enhance faculty and student engagement in industry-based research and development projects. He has contributed to curriculum design for new undergraduate and postgraduate programs in the Energy Cluster at UPES. He also organized the "Kachchh Onshore Mesozoic Field Workshop-2020," which provided field training for geology professionals.

Dr. Patidar has received several accolades, including the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) from a DST-sponsored project, the Senior Research Fellowship (SRF) from CSIR, and recognition for his presentations at scientific conferences. He holds a Coursera certification in Virtual Teacher Specialization from the University of California Irvine and Duke University, enhancing his capabilities in online teaching.
