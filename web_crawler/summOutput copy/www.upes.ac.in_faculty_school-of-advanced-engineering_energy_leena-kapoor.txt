Dr. Leena Kapoor is an Associate Professor in the School of Advanced Engineering at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), where she has been a faculty member since August 2011. She holds a PhD in Chemical Engineering and specializes in both core and elective courses within the discipline. Core courses she teaches include Process Dynamics Control, Mass Transfer Operations, and Chemical Reaction Engineering, while her elective courses cover topics such as Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Technologies, Chemical Process Safety, and Fundamentals of Bioenergy.

Dr. Kapoor's teaching philosophy emphasizes collaborative learning, where she sees her role as a leader who guides, motivates, and inspires students. She prioritizes fostering independent thinking, analytical reasoning, and problem-solving skills, encouraging students to apply theoretical concepts in practical settings related to Chemical Engineering.

Her research interests are focused on biomass conversion technologies aimed at producing green fuels. Notably, she has designed and developed a twin-screw biomass pyrolysis reactor and conducted tests on various biomass samples to generate biofuels. Recognizing that these biofuels require upgradation to enhance their properties for combustion engines, Dr. Kapoor is currently researching the development of nanocomposite catalysts using transition metals like Ni, Co, Zn, and Fe for this purpose. She has been involved in several internal research projects such as SEED, SODH, and Rise, and is also engaged in an external project funded by UGC DAE CSR, which focuses on upgrading biofuels using nanocomposite catalysts.

Dr. Kapoor has received accolades for her contributions to teaching and research, including a Dedicated Service Award and a Best Presenter Award for her research paper presentation at UPES, Dehradun. Prior to her tenure at UPES, she gained experience as an Engineer Trainee at Jaypee Cement and served as a Guest Lecturer at MJP Rohilkhand University in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh.
