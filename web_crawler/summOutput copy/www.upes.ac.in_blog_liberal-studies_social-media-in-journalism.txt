The content highlights the transformative role of social media in journalism and the media industry as a whole, emphasizing the importance of social media skills for students pursuing careers in fields like public relations, corporate communications, and data analytics. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated social media usage, with platforms such as Twitter becoming crucial for real-time updates from journalists, healthcare professionals, and government bodies. Journalists utilized social media to monitor public sentiment, counter misinformation, and report on vaccine distribution efforts using relevant hashtags like #COVID19 and #VaccinesWork.

The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement is another key example of social media's impact, where platforms facilitated the sharing of videos, organization of protests, and increased awareness of racial injustice. The movement gained traction following the viral sharing of George Floydâ€™s death, leading to widespread global protests.
