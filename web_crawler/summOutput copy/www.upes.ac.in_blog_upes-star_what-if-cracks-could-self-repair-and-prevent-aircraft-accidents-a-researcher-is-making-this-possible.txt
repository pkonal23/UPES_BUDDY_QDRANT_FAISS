Dr. Sravendra Rana, a Senior Associate Professor at the UPES School of Advanced Engineering, is pioneering research in self-healing materials aimed at enhancing aircraft safety. His work addresses a critical issue in aviation: untreated cracks in aircraft components can worsen over time, leading to safety hazards and the need for emergency landings. Dr. Rana's innovative approach involves utilizing biomolecules derived from natural substances, such as castor oil, to create materials that not only stop cracks from deepening but also facilitate self-repair, similar to the healing process in living tissues.

Dr. Rana's academic journey began in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, where he completed his Master's degree. He then pursued a PhD in Seoul, South Korea, focusing on shape memory polymers. Following his doctoral studies, he worked at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and contributed to European Union projects at Martin Luther University in Germany before joining UPES. Throughout his career, he has mentored numerous students in their research endeavors.

Highlighting the health risks associated with traditional catalysts used in self-healing materials, which are often toxic and costly, Dr. Rana emphasizes the need for safer alternatives. His research, which has garnered substantial funding from the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Government of India—INR 55 lakh in 2017 and INR 24 lakh in 2021—aims to develop Vitrimers, a class of self-healing polymer materials that can be reprocessed at low temperatures. This innovation not only promises to improve aircraft safety and reduce maintenance costs but also addresses environmental concerns by enhancing recyclability and reducing carbon emissions.

Dr. Rana's work represents a significant advancement in the aeronautical industry, potentially allowing aircraft to self-repair micro-cracks and withstand impacts from space debris, thereby increasing safety, productivity, and the lifespan of airplanes. His research is poised to revolutionize the field, making air travel safer for hundreds of passengers.
