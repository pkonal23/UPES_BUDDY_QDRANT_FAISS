The Rural Women Technology Park has been actively engaged in empowering women from nearby villages around the university campus since its inception in 2015. This initiative focuses on several key areas, including the production of recycled paper products, the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in art and craft design, and the identification and cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plant species. 

Women participating in the project are provided with support from campus experts who assist them in marketing their products, facilitating their transition into budding entrepreneurs.
