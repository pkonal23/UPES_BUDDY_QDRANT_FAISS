The UPES School of Law is actively engaged in various academic and extracurricular initiatives that enhance the educational experience of its students. Notably, Shubhransi Kumar, a student from UPES, participated in a semester exchange program at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), highlighting the global opportunities available to students.

Emerging legal specializations are a crucial focus for law students, particularly those pursuing an LL.B. degree. The school emphasizes the importance of understanding the implications of advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) on the legal profession, as well as the career prospects following an LL.M. in International Law. The school also recognizes the significance of competition law in promoting fair market practices and consumer protection in India.

Students at UPES have the chance to win accolades, including cash prizes and internships with leading law firms, through various competitions. For instance, the UPES ADR fest 'Madhyastham' provides a platform for students to engage in alternative dispute resolution competitions, enhancing their practical skills.

The UPES curriculum offers a choice between a BBA LL.B. and a BA LL.B., allowing students to tailor their education according to their career aspirations. The legal landscape is evolving, with new areas of law such as cyber law becoming increasingly relevant due to rising issues like cyberbullying and harassment.

In addition to traditional legal education, the school encourages participatory learning and skills development, such as debating and client counseling, which are essential for successful legal practice. The intersection of law and technology is also a key theme, as students are prepared to navigate the changing dynamics of the legal field.

UPES alumni have achieved notable success, including recognition in the Bihar Judiciary Examination. The school fosters a community of aspiring lawyers who are equipped to address contemporary legal challenges, including environmental law and international arbitration.
