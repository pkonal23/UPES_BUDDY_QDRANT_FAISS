Choosing between a B.Sc. Honours degree and a B.Sc. degree is a significant decision for students interested in science and technology. This choice impacts their educational and career trajectories, especially in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), which are rapidly evolving and in high demand. 

The UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies) has been recognized for its innovative contributions, such as being one of the finalists at Toycathon 2021, where UPES students presented a unique gaming idea to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The university is also heavily investing in research, earmarking ₹50 crore for an AI Center of Excellence to foster cutting-edge research and empower future AI professionals.

AI and ML are particularly attractive career paths in the 21st century, offering high salary potential, job satisfaction, and the opportunity to work on impactful projects. According to Glassdoor, AI engineers had a median base salary of $146,085, while ML engineers earned $142,859 in 2020. The World Economic Forum forecasts a 41% increase in AI and ML jobs between 2020 and 2025, translating to approximately 1 million new positions across various sectors.

Students can pursue diverse roles in AI and ML, such as AI/ML Product Managers, AI/ML Engineers, Data Scientists, AI/ML Researchers, and Consultants. These roles require a blend of technical skills, analytical abilities, and soft skills. For those interested in deepening their understanding of technology, a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) is recommended.

UPES continues to support its alumni, with recent news highlighting UPES graduates securing ₹4 crore in seed funding for a tech start-up. Additionally, UPES faculty members have actively participated in industry events, such as the Pune Design Festival, where they discussed topics like the Metaverse.

For further information, students interested in AI and ML courses or seeking admission at UPES can reach out to the university through their official channels. The UPES Editorial Team is available for inquiries and can provide additional insights into their programs and offerings.
