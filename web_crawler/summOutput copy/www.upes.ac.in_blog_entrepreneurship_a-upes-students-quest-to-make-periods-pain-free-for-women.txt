A study by Women’s Health Concern reveals that approximately 80% of women globally experience period pain, also known as dysmenorrhoea, which is characterized by lower abdominal pain and is the most common symptom associated with menstruation. This condition affects women from their early teens to menopause, with 10% experiencing severe pain that disrupts their daily lives. 

Nuveni Raina, a second-year design student at UPES, has taken a proactive approach to address this issue by founding a start-up named ‘Vindyavasini’. This venture focuses on creating a period cramp relief belt that alleviates menstrual cramps through regulated heat and vibrations, which can be adjusted via an app. Nuveni's initiative is aimed at providing a practical solution for women, particularly targeting those in urban areas first, with future plans to extend the product's reach to rural women by collaborating with governments and NGOs. She emphasizes the importance of ensuring that every woman, regardless of her location or economic status, has access to the product to experience pain-free periods.

Nuveni's start-up recently secured INR 1 lakh in funding from Rahul Narvekar, CEO of The India Network, through the Runway Incubator. She intends to use these funds to enhance her prototype to better meet user needs. In her marketing strategy, she plans to promote the product widely across various channels, distribute prototypes for user feedback, and engage with companies already involved in the sector.
