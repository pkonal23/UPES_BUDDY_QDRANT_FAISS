Pranav Khalikar, a student of MBA Logistics and Supply Chain Management at UPES School of Business, shares his enriching experience during an international exchange program at the University of Maribor, Slovenia, which he participated in after being inspired by the opportunities available at UPES. The program allowed him to immerse himself in a new culture, as he found that English was not widely spoken in Slovenia, prompting him to learn Slovene basics. Additionally, his Turkish roommate introduced him to the Turkish language.

During the welcome week, Pranav participated in an event called ‘Polyglot,’ where he conversed in various languages, including French, Dutch, Spanish, and German, enhancing his linguistic skills. He also engaged in culinary experiences, trying numerous European dishes and cooking with fellow students in their dorm’s common kitchen. The ‘International Dinner’ event allowed him to taste around 20 different dishes made from various students' family recipes, showcasing the diverse culinary heritage present among the 43 nationalities represented in his program.

Pranav highlights the transformative nature of the exchange program, which not only boosted his confidence but also enhanced his employability by exposing him to different cultures and global cuisines. He emphasizes that the experience taught him self-reliance and adaptability, essential skills for navigating new environments. The opportunity to travel across Europe with discounted travel options provided by his host university allowed him to explore 20 cities in 11 different countries, marking significant personal achievement.

He notes that participation in such programs is beneficial for career prospects, as it reflects qualities like leadership, adaptability, and openness to new experiences, which are appealing to recruiters. Pranav encourages others to seize such opportunities for personal and professional growth, asserting that the student exchange program was a memorable and life-changing experience.
