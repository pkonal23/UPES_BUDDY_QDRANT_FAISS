In recent years, intercollegiate sports have transformed into a lucrative multi-million-dollar industry, significantly impacting the behavior and achievements of student-athletes, particularly through the availability of scholarships. Dr. Nishant Mishra, Dean of Student Welfare at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), emphasizes the institution's commitment to holistic student development, viewing extra-curricular activities like sports as integral to academic life.

In a notable initiative, UPES has launched Project Vijay, which will provide 50 sports scholarships for students excelling in various sports, including cricket, football, athletics, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, badminton, shooting, and chess. The scholarships, announced in the presence of Uttarakhand Chief Minister Shri Pushkar Singh Dhami, will cover 35% to 100% of tuition fees based on the students' achievements and representation in national or international competitions. Dr. Sunil Rai, Vice Chancellor of UPES, highlighted that this initiative aims to support economically disadvantaged students passionate about sports.

UPES has also made strides in fostering a vibrant sports culture by forming all-women sports teams, collaborating with other universities for a year-long Sports League, and organizing a sports fest for Ph.D. scholars. The university's cricket team, Team Orange, has notably achieved championship status in a prestigious tournament organized by the Cricket Association of Uttarakhand.

Recent athletic achievements at UPES include staff member Sanyam Arora's selection for the Uttarakhand state cricket team and alumnus Navneet Singh's accolades, including a silver medal at the Commonwealth Games and a gold at the National Games in Menâ€™s Lawn Balls. The UPES shooting team, comprising Sezal Maan, Deeya Chopra, and Geethika Konasani, recently triumphed in an inter-college shooting championship, further showcasing the university's commitment to sports.

Dr. Sravendra Rana from the School of Advanced Engineering is also making significant contributions to aviation safety through the development of self-repairing materials aimed at preventing airplane accidents, marking a potential breakthrough in the aeronautical industry.

In conclusion, UPES is rapidly establishing itself as a premier institution for aspiring athletes, providing them with the necessary support and resources to excel both academically and in their respective sports.
