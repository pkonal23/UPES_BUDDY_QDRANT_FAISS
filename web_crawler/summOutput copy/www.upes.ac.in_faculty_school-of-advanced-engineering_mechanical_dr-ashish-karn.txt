Dr. Ashish Karn serves as a Senior Associate Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering, where he integrates his research into his teaching philosophy, adhering to the principles of 'teach what you research' and 'research what you teach.' This approach has fostered innovative methodologies in engineering education, emphasizing active learning through various dynamic techniques such as physical demonstrations, simulations, digital storytelling, and computational tools. Dr. Karn is dedicated to developing customized computational tools and software tailored to the needs of his students, with additional resources available at his website, drkarnteaching.com.

His research interests encompass Experimental Fluid Dynamics, Aerodynamics, Multiphase Flows, Small and Kinetic Hydro Power, and the Indian Knowledge System in Science and Engineering. Dr. Karn's primary research focus is on multiphase flows, which have applications ranging from underwater vehicles to mitigating silt erosion in hydroturbines. As an experimental fluid dynamicist, he explores innovative flow visualization techniques that yield valuable insights into contemporary Indian society. His research includes technical projects, such as utilizing bubbles to prevent silt erosion at hydropower stations, and more relatable studies, such as the mechanics of mustard seed propulsion in Indian cooking. Notably, he has conducted groundbreaking work on the acoustics of a unique Indian flute that can be played without the use of lips.

Dr. Karn's research is intricately linked to societal needs, and he employs game-like methods to teach science, mathematics, and aspects of Indian culture, challenging the Eurocentric perspectives of scientific development. He has explored the roots of biomimicry within Indian culture and its applications across various engineering disciplines.

Prior to his tenure at UPES, Dr. Karn was a joint Graduate Research Assistant at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory and the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, USA. His academic achievements include multiple awards and grants from institutions in India and abroad, such as the Early Career Research Award from the Science and Engineering Research Board, DST India, and support from the National Innovation Foundation and the Ministry of Education, GOI. He has also been recognized in national competitions like Toycathon-2021 and the COVID Innovation Challenge, and has received the Edward Silberman Award and Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship for his scientific research excellence.

Dr. Karn teaches undergraduate courses including Fluid Mechanics, Fluid Machinery, Heat Transfer, and Aerodynamics, alongside courses in Image Processing, Data Science, Programming, Biomimicry, and Indian Knowledge Systems in Science and Engineering. He holds an undergraduate degree from IIT Delhi and completed his MS and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, from the University of Minnesota, USA.
