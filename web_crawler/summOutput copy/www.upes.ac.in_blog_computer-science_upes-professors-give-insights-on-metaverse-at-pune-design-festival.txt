Choosing between a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) Honours degree and a standard B.Sc. degree is a significant decision for students interested in science and technology. The distinction lies in the depth of study and potential career opportunities each path offers. 

Recent discussions led by researchers like Lee, Li-Hang et al. have highlighted the emergence of digital twins in a digitalized world, alongside the rise of digital natives in various virtual environments, and the importance of integrating physical and virtual realities. 

On February 19, 2025, Pankaj Badoni, an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science, along with Dr. Anmol Srivastava from the School of Design, participated in a workshop titled "Into the Metaverse – AR/VR" at the Pune Design Festival 2022. This event aimed to clarify the complexities surrounding the Metaverse, which combines augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR). The workshop underscored the importance of creating immersive environments in the Metaverse, where users can interact across different virtual spaces.

The concept of the Metaverse has evolved significantly, tracing back to literature and early interactive games, and has been popularized by figures like Mark Zuckerberg. It encompasses various technologies such as AI, blockchain, and computer vision, all aimed at creating a seamless blend of real and virtual experiences. The integration of machine learning in computer science is also emphasized, showcasing its transformative potential across multiple industries.

In the realm of AR, applications span education, healthcare, retail, gaming, and tourism. Notable examples include IKEA's AR app, which allows users to visualize furniture in their homes before purchase. The workshop participants discussed the implications of AR in enhancing user experiences in the Metaverse, stressing the need for interactivity and realistic imagery.

UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies) has been proactive in fostering innovation and research in these fields, investing ₹50 crore to establish an AI Center of Excellence. UPES aims to equip students with the skills necessary to thrive in an increasingly digital world, offering programs in Computer Science, Engineering, and Design.
