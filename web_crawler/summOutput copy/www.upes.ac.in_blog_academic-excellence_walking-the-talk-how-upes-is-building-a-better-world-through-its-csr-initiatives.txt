The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) is launching a project aimed at promoting safe, healthy, and sustainable menstrual practices among women, particularly targeting underprivileged groups. The initiative involves the distribution of approximately 1,200 reusable menstrual cups, which can last for up to ten years. To ensure proper usage, training sessions will be conducted, followed by a 90-day support period that includes on-field and telephonic follow-ups managed by DivIn Pro, a women-led BPO.

This project is part of UPES's broader Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, which also include the establishment of LearnShalasâ€”vibrant learning centers in four government primary schools in Uttarakhand. These centers aim to enhance the educational experience for children by providing engaging learning materials and fostering critical thinking. The initiative is designed to address educational inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, with a focus on nurturing future leaders among students.

UPES is also committed to empowering its support staff through a Skills Academy, which will provide training in computer skills and English communication. The program is intended to uplift staff members, such as security guards and housekeeping personnel, by enhancing their skill sets for better job performance and opportunities.

Additionally, UPES recently hosted DaanUtsav, a festival celebrating the spirit of giving, where staff and students donated clothes, books, and other essential items to the underprivileged in local communities. The university is also focused on bridging the gap between academia and industry by appointing experienced legal practitioners as Professors of Practice in its School of Law.

For further details or inquiries regarding UPES initiatives, interested parties may contact the university directly, although specific contact details were not provided in the text.

Overall, UPES's efforts underscore its commitment to social equity, sustainable practices, and educational enhancement, all aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
