In 2021, the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) was honored with three awards recognizing its leadership in driving change, enhancing student learning experiences, and advancing teaching methodologies. This follows its earlier achievement of winning the Blackboard Catalyst award for Professional Development in 2019 and for Optimizing Student Experience in 2018, awarded to Mr. Ravindra Yatagiri.

UPES has embraced a future-oriented educational model known as the University of Tomorrow, where most courses are offered online at near-zero marginal costs. The primary goal of this initiative is to provide students with 24/7 access to learning resources in a format that best suits their individual learning preferences.

To support this innovative approach, UPES has implemented a cutting-edge, mobile-enabled virtual learning and collaboration platform, which has replaced the university's legacy systems. This transition reflects a growing acknowledgment of the importance of hybrid, blended, and online learning as essential components of modern educational strategies.

In response to the increasing demand for video content in education, UPES has established an e-studio equipped with integrated platforms that empower faculty to create engaging video lectures. The university actively promotes blended learning, combining various teaching methods such as classroom instruction, e-learning, video lectures, online assessments, and interactive digital textbooks featuring embedded animations.

UPES is committed to providing a unique and advanced digital learning experience that fosters student engagement and success, ultimately leading to meaningful outcomes that support student achievement and career advancement. The institution's dedication to innovation in education is evident through its accolades and the comprehensive learning opportunities it offers.
