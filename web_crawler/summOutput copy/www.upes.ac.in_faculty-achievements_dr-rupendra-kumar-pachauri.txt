The content discusses the significance of Networked DC Microgrid Transactive Energy Systems in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the power grid. These systems facilitate the connection of decentralized energy sources to the main power grid, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy, thereby lowering the carbon footprint globally. Additionally, microgrids offer resilience by allowing independent operation during outages or disruptions, which is particularly beneficial in disaster-prone areas and for critical infrastructure.

The management challenges associated with traditional power grids can be mitigated through Transactive Energy Management. The research emphasizes the exploration of various DC microgrid models to address future power demands and ensure fair cost allocation among energy stakeholders. Overall, networked microgrid topologies are pivotal in enhancing grid performance, ensuring service continuity during blackouts, and facilitating a broader adoption of renewable energy sources.

In terms of faculty achievements, Dr. Rupendra Kumar Pachauri from the School of Advanced Engineering participated in a research collaboration project titled "Networked DC Micro-grids: Transactive Energy System" with the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok, Thailand. His visit to the Energy Transition Department, School of Energy Resource and Development (SERD), lasted from July to September 2022, where he focused on Transactive Energy Management for Networked DC Microgrids. The primary research objectives included studying DC microgrid hybrid power generation.
