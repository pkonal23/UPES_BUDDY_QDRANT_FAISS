The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has established a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observations Sciences (ARIES). This collaboration aims to enhance the educational experience of UPES students pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Physics with a focus on Astronomy and Astrophysics. Through this partnership, students will gain access to cutting-edge astronomical instruments available at ARIES, enabling them to engage in hands-on exploration of astronomical entities and decode astronomical events.

The MoU is expected to significantly benefit students by providing practical exposure and industry connections in the field of astronomy. It serves as a bridge between academic learning and real-world applications in the area of astronomical research.
