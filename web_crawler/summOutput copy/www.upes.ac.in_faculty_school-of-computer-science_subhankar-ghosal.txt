Dr. Subhakar Ghosal is an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science (SoCS) at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) since 2023. He holds an M.Tech and a PhD in Computer Science from the Indian Statistical Institute, which he completed in January 2022. Prior to his academic position, he worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Auriss Technology Pvt Limited, where he contributed to research and development after submitting his thesis in 2021.

Dr. Ghosal's research interests are focused on bridging the gap between theoretical computer science and its practical applications, particularly in the fields of randomized algorithms, resource allocation, device-to-device communication, and machine learning. He emphasizes the importance of applying theoretical concepts to solve real-world problems, noting that many theoretical advancements remain unutilized in practical scenarios. His work involves the application of randomized algorithms in 5G-6G device-to-device communication, which utilize random numbers for decision-making and offer probabilistic efficiency guarantees. A significant contribution of his research is a new paradigm of randomized algorithms that improves the optimum hitting probability exponentially based on the problem size.

Dr. Ghosal's teaching philosophy centers around the integration of mathematics and computer science, where he advocates for teaching mathematical concepts alongside practical examples, simple coding, and visual aids to enhance understanding. He teaches courses in Operations Research and Optimization, both in theory and lab settings.
