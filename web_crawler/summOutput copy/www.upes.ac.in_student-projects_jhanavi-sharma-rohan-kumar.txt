The COVAT Study, officially titled "Cross-sectional coronavirus vaccine-induced antibody test," was conducted to assess the serological response of the Indian cohort in Uttarakhand. This study took place on May 3 and 4, 2023, at the UPES campus and was jointly funded by Genotypic Technology Pvt. Ltd. and UPES R&D. The primary aim of the serosurvey was to determine whether the COVID-19 vaccines administered had effectively induced an antibody response in the subjects, especially during a time when India was experiencing thousands of COVID-19 cases. Understanding the antibody response was crucial for informing the public about the necessity of booster shots, as the vaccines, while not effective against all virus variants, were shown to reduce viral load and the severity of the disease.

The project was executed by students Jhanavi Sharma and Rohan Kumar, who were pursuing their MSc in Microbiology and an Integrated BSc-MSc program during their tenure in 2021. The study was mentored by Dr. Smriti Arora and was part of the student projects at the School of Health Sciences and Technology.
