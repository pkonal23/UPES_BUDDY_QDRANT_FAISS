Syed Mohd Raza Taqvi, a student pursuing an MBA in Oil and Gas Management at UPES School of Business (2021-2023), reflects on his transformative experiences during his time at UC Berkeley, specifically through the Berkeley Haas Global Access Program (BHGAP). This program allowed him to immerse himself in an environment with significant cultural diversity, as he interacted with classmates from all seven continents, enriching his understanding of global business dynamics.

The UPES School of Business recently hosted over 60 exchange students from 27 different countries, celebrating cultural diversity through a global culinary event featuring dishes from various nations, including Mexico and Gambia. This initiative aligns with UPES's commitment to fostering a global outlook among its students.

Syed expresses profound appreciation for the opportunities provided by UPES, particularly the Study Abroad program, which enabled him to study at one of the worldâ€™s most prestigious institutions. His six-month experience in the BHGAP focused on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which significantly broadened his horizons and cultural competence. He highlights the importance of networking and cultural exchanges that occurred outside the classroom, which enhanced his perspectives on global issues.

He also emphasizes the invaluable insights gained from company visits to industry leaders such as Accenture, Amazon Web Services, Apple, and Google, which bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Additionally, he was actively involved in the Student Advisory Board at Berkeley Haas, where he honed his leadership and event planning skills while contributing to the student community.

One unforgettable experience was attending the Berkeley-Stanford football game, which showcased the competitive spirit and pride of the Berkeley community, fostering unity among students and alumni.

In conclusion, Syed expresses gratitude towards UPES for facilitating his life-changing educational journey, which has equipped him with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in a global business environment. The state-of-the-art facilities at Berkeley, including sports amenities, further enhanced his overall experience.
