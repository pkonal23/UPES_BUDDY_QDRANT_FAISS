The workshops led by Professor Miles Hewstone from the University of Oxford were designed to equip participants with essential skills for developing research ideas, writing impactful research articles, and navigating the academic publishing landscape. Organized by the UPES School of Liberal Studies and Media, these workshops provided an exceptional opportunity for students and faculty to learn from a distinguished figure in social psychology.

Prof. Hewstone, a former Professor of Social Psychology with a rich academic background that includes positions at Bristol, Mannheim, and Cardiff Universities, is a distinguished fellow at New College, Oxford. His extensive teaching experience and engagement with diverse student bodies significantly enhance the value of his workshops.

The workshop series took place at the Kandoli Campus of UPES in Dehradun from August 27 to 29, 2024. It included two main sessions: the first day focused on "How to Be a Researcher? Developing Ideas for Research and Publishing Your Findings," where key topics included crafting hypotheses, structuring research, and managing peer reviews. Prof. Hewstone emphasized the importance of clear communication, proper punctuation, and avoiding jargon.

The second day featured a workshop titled "Research Writing Unplugged: Lessons from a Pro (and His Slip-Ups!)," where Prof. Hewstone discussed common mistakes made by researchers and provided practical advice for overcoming these challenges. Participants explored themes such as open science, triangulation, and the difficulties associated with rejection in the academic world.

The workshops were open to faculty from other universities and streamed online, allowing for global participation. They attracted students, researchers, and faculty from various schools at UPES and other institutions, fostering an inclusive academic environment.

In addition to the workshops, Prof. Hewstone delivered lectures on significant topics in social psychology, covering the history and seminal experiments in the field. He examined the reasons behind conformity, the influence of social norms on decision-making, and the psychological factors that drive aggression and altruism. His lectures provided insights into both the positive and negative effects of social group dynamics, enriching participants' understanding of the forces that shape social interactions.

Overall, the workshops offered invaluable insights into the academic research process, guided by one of the leading experts in the field.
