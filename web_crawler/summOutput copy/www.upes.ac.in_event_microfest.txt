This inaugural event, which will become an annual tradition known as UPES Microfest, aimed to emphasize the importance of microorganisms and the ongoing research in Health Sciences.

He highlighted the challenges posed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has developed resistance to existing treatments. Prof. Raj emphasized the necessity for collaboration between academia and industry to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR) effectively, noting that drug discovery is a complex and high-risk process that can cost around $1 billion per drug and take 10-15 years from discovery to patient availability.
