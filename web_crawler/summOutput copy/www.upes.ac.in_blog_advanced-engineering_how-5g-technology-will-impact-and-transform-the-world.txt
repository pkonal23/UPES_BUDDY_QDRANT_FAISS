A recent study indicates that approximately 40 million smartphone users in India are projected to adopt 5G technology within its first year of availability, with many willing to pay 50% more for plans that include bundled digital services. The National Education Policy 2020 highlights the importance of research and innovation, calling for enhanced financial support for academic research.

The introduction of 5G technology is expected to significantly reduce costs, downtime, and wastage while improving productivity across various sectors, particularly in smart manufacturing through enhanced remote monitoring and automation capabilities. Dr. C. P. Ramanarayanan, Vice-Chancellor of the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT), elaborates on the advanced engineering capabilities of Rafale jets and the evolving nature of warfare.

Emerging job opportunities for graduates in aerospace engineering, sustainable engineering, and electric vehicle technology are highlighted, emphasizing the growing demand for energy engineers, solar energy system engineers, and project managers in renewable energy sectors. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) in India has surged by 42%, indicating a transformative shift in the automotive industry.

5G technology is anticipated to revolutionize various sectors, including healthcare and smart cities. It will enable enhanced mobile broadband and fixed wireless access, addressing the current low penetration of fixed broadband in India and improving user data experiences. The technology supports innovations such as automated diagnostics and advanced medical equipment, which are essential for modern healthcare delivery.

The educational landscape is evolving, with a focus on engineering disciplines such as Mechatronics, Civil, and Chemical Engineering, as well as the burgeoning fields of Clean Energy Technologies and Space Technology, providing diverse career paths for graduates. The UPES School of Engineering is noted for its commitment to experiential learning, including industrial tours and collaborations with organizations like ISRO and Bharat Dynamics Limited.

In summary, the integration of 5G technology is set to enhance connectivity, drive economic growth, and improve living standards through smart city initiatives while also reshaping the job market for engineering graduates in India.
