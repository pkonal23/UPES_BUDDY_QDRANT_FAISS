The UPES School of Design has achieved notable recognition through its Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) program, particularly in the field of game design. Mentored by industry experts from IBM and IKEA, UPES design students have garnered multiple accolades, including the ‘CII Young Designer Award 2022,’ the D’source DIC-BHU Award from IIT Bombay, and an honourable mention at the Student Service Design Challenge 2022 during Barcelona Design Week.

B.Des. graduates specializing in game design are becoming key contributors to the gaming industry, leveraging their diverse skill sets, creative thinking, and user-centric approaches to innovate and redefine game mechanics. Their expertise enables them to create captivating gameplay elements, from interactive storytelling to adaptive difficulty levels, significantly enhancing player experiences.

The B.Des. curriculum offers a comprehensive educational journey covering various aspects of design, including graphic design, animation, and user experience (UX) design, with a particular focus on game design. This specialization equips graduates with a deep understanding of the gaming ecosystem, allowing them to bridge the gap between artistry and technology, which is crucial for developing visually stunning and functional gaming environments.

Students pursuing a B.Des. can expect a career rich in creativity and innovation. The rise of indie game development has been notably influenced by B.Des. graduates, who are known for their ability to think outside the box and implement unique design concepts that challenge industry norms. Their collaborative skills enable them to work effectively with programmers, animators, and writers, resulting in well-rounded games that appeal to diverse audiences.

Internship opportunities are an essential part of the B.Des. experience, providing students with practical exposure to the professional world. For example, UPES student Kavya Jayaprakash secured a four-and-a-half-month paid internship with Accenture during a semester exchange program in France.

The B.Des. program spans four years and covers a wide range of topics, including research methodology, game history, user experience, character and environment design, programming, and game engines. Graduates can pursue various careers, such as game designers, art directors, asset designers, and UI/UX designers.

For those interested in furthering their education, UPES offers a Master of Design (M.Des.) degree, which can elevate their design careers. The demand for immersive gaming experiences continues to grow, making B.Des. graduates highly sought after in both established game studios and startups.
