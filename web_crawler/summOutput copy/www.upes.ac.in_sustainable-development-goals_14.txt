Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) focuses on the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and marine resources. Its primary objectives include preventing marine pollution, protecting biodiversity, and promoting sustainable fisheries to ensure the health of oceans, which is vital for a resilient and balanced global ecosystem.

The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has implemented several key activities and policies in support of SDG 14:

1. **Access for Artisanal Fishers**: UPES works to provide small-scale artisanal fishers with access to marine resources and markets, enhancing their livelihoods.

2. **Educational Programs**: The university offers degree programs in Geology, Environmental Sciences, Earth Sciences, and Marine Sciences, contributing to the education and training of professionals in these critical areas.

3. **Addressing Ocean Acidification**: UPES is focused on minimizing the impacts of ocean acidification, which poses a significant threat to marine life.

4. **Fisheries Management**: The university advocates for the prohibition of certain fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, promoting sustainable fishing practices.

5. **Research and Technology**: There is an emphasis on enhancing scientific knowledge, research capacity, and the transfer of marine technology to support ocean health.

6. **Marine Conservation**: UPES aims to conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, which is crucial for biodiversity preservation.

7. **Pollution Prevention**: Efforts are underway to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution, which is essential for the health of marine ecosystems.

8. **Regulation of Fishing Practices**: The university supports regulating harvesting practices to eliminate overfishing and combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

9. **Economic Benefits for Developing Regions**: UPES seeks to increase economic benefits to small island developing states and least developed countries through the sustainable use of marine resources.

10. **Ecosystem Management**: The institution is committed to sustainably managing and protecting marine and coastal ecosystems.

Additionally, UPES is involved in projects such as designing mitigation measures to reduce fishnet entanglement of dugongs in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII).

In summary, UPES plays a significant role in promoting the objectives of SDG 14 through education, research, and policy advocacy aimed at protecting marine environments and supporting sustainable practices in marine resource utilization.
