Dr. Ratnesh K Pandey, an Assistant Professor-Selection Grade in the Applied Science Cluster, has received a significant grant of 34 lakhs from the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS), India. This funding will support a three-year research project aimed at investigating radiation damage in materials intended for fusion reactor applications. 

The research will focus on understanding the interactions between high-energy particles, such as neutrons and ions, and various candidate materials for fusion reactors. Dr. Pandey plans to simulate and analyze how these materials behave under radiation exposure, thereby enhancing current knowledge of radiation damage mechanisms and developing strategies to mitigate negative impacts.

With the backing of BRNS-India, Dr. Pandey is poised to collaborate with experts in the field and utilize advanced facilities and techniques to further the research. His work aims to contribute significantly to the development of materials that can endure the harsh conditions of fusion reactors, ultimately facilitating the advancement of fusion energy technology. This research is crucial for overcoming one of the main challenges in harnessing fusion energy as a clean and sustainable power source, which has the potential to generate large amounts of electricity with minimal environmental repercussions.

Dr. Pandey's efforts will not only deepen the understanding of radiation effects on materials but also play a pivotal role in moving closer to a sustainable, carbon-free energy future.
