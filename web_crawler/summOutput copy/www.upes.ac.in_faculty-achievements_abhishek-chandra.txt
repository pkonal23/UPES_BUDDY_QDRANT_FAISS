The study focuses on the application of ultrasound and osmotic dehydration as pretreatment methods to enhance the preservation of papaya's nutritional and functional qualities during conventional hot air drying. The research evaluates various parameters of dried papaya slices, including moisture content, water activity, total phenolic content, Î²-carotene levels, color, antioxidant activity, microstructure, and texture. The findings suggest that using ultrasound and osmotic dehydration as pretreatments before drying is beneficial for maintaining the quality of papaya slices.
