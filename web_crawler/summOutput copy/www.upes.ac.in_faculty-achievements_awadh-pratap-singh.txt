Awadh Pratap Singh has made significant contributions to the field of performance efficiency assessment through his proposed bi-objective fuzzy data envelopment analysis (BOFDEA) model. This innovative approach utilizes ùõº-cuts to evaluate the efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) in uncertain environments, building upon the foundations of fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FDEA). The BOFDEA model addresses two objectives and introduces a solution method along with a ranking system. Unlike traditional methods where efficiency scores are presented as intervals‚Äîwhich complicates the ranking process‚Äîthis model provides efficiency results in a crisp form, simplifying the ranking of DMUs and reducing computational effort. The validity of the BOFDEA model has been demonstrated through numerical examples and a practical application in the education sector.

Additionally, Awadh Pratap Singh's abstract, titled "Computing and Predicting Efficiency of Educational Institutions Using Machine Learning Data Envelopment Analysis," was selected for presentation at the International Conference on Nonlinear Applied Analysis & Optimization (2022) held at the Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University) in Varanasi from December 19-22, 2022. This study proposes a novel method that integrates data envelopment analysis (DEA) with machine learning (ML) algorithms to measure and predict the efficiency of DMUs. The research highlights a significant challenge in traditional DEA, where assessing a new DMU's efficiency necessitates a complete re-evaluation, which can be computationally intensive. Singh's approach aims to establish a relationship between DEA and ML, specifically through three ML-DEA algorithms: support vector machines (SVM-DEA) and random forests (RF-DEA). The study focuses on measuring and comparing the performance of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) with the efficiency scores derived from the DEA model.
