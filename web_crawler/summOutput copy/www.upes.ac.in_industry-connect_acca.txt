UPES School of Business has partnered with the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) to enhance the accounting education offered to its students. This collaboration aims to provide a comprehensive course plan designed by industry experts, allowing students to earn a dual qualification: an ACCA certification alongside a BBA in finance degree. This dual qualification significantly boosts global recognition for graduates.

The ACCA program emphasizes practical application in accounting, offering exclusive content, additional tests, mock exams, and virtual sessions. Students also benefit from free registration with ACCA, based in the UK. The global recognition of ACCA, applicable in over 180 countries, opens numerous job opportunities for graduates in multinational companies. ACCA actively shares job openings on a global platform, making it easier for students to access diverse roles such as Financial Analyst, Taxation Expert, Auditor, and Accountant, even if they have a few ACCA papers remaining.

Furthermore, students pursuing ACCA certification receive support for placement and internship opportunities in the finance and accounting sectors. This partnership signifies a transformative educational journey for UPES School of Business students, merging academic excellence with global standards in accounting education and showcasing the institution's commitment to preparing students for successful careers in the global business environment.
