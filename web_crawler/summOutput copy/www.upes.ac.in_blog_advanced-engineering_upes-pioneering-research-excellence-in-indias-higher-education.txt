The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) is making significant strides in health and environmental sciences research, particularly through the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research and Innovation (CIDRI). Under the leadership of Dr. Aashish Mathur, the team is focusing on developing nanotechnology-based sensors intended for disease detection and environmental safety. These innovative sensors are designed to detect heavy metals in water, identify milk adulterants, and test for drugs in beverages, with the goal of providing affordable healthcare and enhancing safety measures.

In another notable initiative, Dr. Nidhi Chauhan and her team at the School of Health Science and Technology (SoHST) have received a prestigious grant from BIRAC to establish the SWACHH incubation center at UPES. This center, the first SPARSH - BIRAC Center in Uttarakhand, will focus on Climate Resilience, Farm-to-Plate initiatives, and Public Health over the next five years, mentoring young social innovators and developing prototypes and technologies.

The university recognizes the growing demand for careers in sustainable and renewable engineering, with opportunities for energy engineering graduates in roles such as solar energy system engineers and wind farm designers. Additionally, the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has transformed the automotive industry, with EV sales in India increasing by 42%, indicating a shift towards sustainable transportation.

UPES has also been active in fostering academic excellence and industry collaborations. The university has seen a remarkable growth in scholarly output, with a Field-Weighted Citation Impact of 1.76 in 2023 and 1.59 in 2024. Approximately 54% of UPESâ€™s publications are among the top 10% of journals by CiteScore percentiles. The institution has partnered with international universities and industry leaders, including collaborations with Russian bioenergy experts to innovate biodiesel production using AI and ML algorithms.

Recent initiatives include the BEST (Bajaj Engineering Skills Training) program, which received substantial funding to set up labs in Robotics, Mechatronics, IoT, and Smart Manufacturing. This initiative marks UPES as a leader in engineering education in Uttarakhand.

Furthermore, Dr. Bhawna Lamba is pioneering a wastewater reclamation project utilizing microalgae for sewage purification, achieving a zero-waste solution. This project, along with others in sustainable energy research, reinforces UPES's commitment to addressing environmental challenges.

UPES continues to attract top academic leaders, enhancing its educational offerings with esteemed faculty members specializing in various fields, including AI, ML, and mathematical modeling. The university's interdisciplinary approach ensures a robust educational experience for its students, preparing them for future challenges in engineering and technology.
