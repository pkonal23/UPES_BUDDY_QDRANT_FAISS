The project on the development of a Probiotic Ready-to-Serve (RTS) drink was undertaken by students Om Shri, Lakshita Sharma, and Rashi Aggarwal, who are pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Food Nutrition and Dietetics. Their research focused on creating a beverage using Himalayan fruits and whey water specifically designed for toddlers. 

The initiative emphasizes the health benefits of probiotics, which are live microorganisms that contribute positively to human health. The students aimed to formulate and characterize probiotic beverages that not only enhance immune function but also improve overall well-being. The project highlights the significance of probiotics in alleviating digestive issues such as bloating and gas, making the drink beneficial for young consumers. 

The primary goal of this project was to develop a beverage rich in probiotics, containing live microorganisms that aid digestion while also reducing the intake of excess sugars typically found in sweetened drinks. 

The project was mentored by Dr. Shuchi Upadhyay Tiwari, indicating a collaborative effort between the students and faculty at the School of Health Sciences and Technology.
