Ayushi Malik, a student pursuing her M.Tech. in Computer Science with a specialization in Cyber Security and Forensic, has achieved significant recognition for her contributions to the field. She has been granted a patent by the Indian Copyright Office for her work on "Implementing Biometrics in Banking KYC: Improved Security and Privacy." This patent highlights her innovative approach to enhancing security and privacy in banking processes.

In addition to her patent, Malik has published research papers at notable conferences, including the 2nd International Conference on Innovative Sustainable and the Fourth International Conference on Computing, Communication and Cyber-Security (IC4S-2022). Her paper, titled “Proposed Framework for Implementation of Biometrics in Banking KYC,” addresses the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in banking, particularly as financial transactions increasingly shift to digital platforms.

The paper emphasizes that cybersecurity encompasses a range of technologies, policies, and operations aimed at safeguarding networks, devices, software, and data from various threats, including intrusions, malware, and hacking. The primary goal of data security in banking is to protect customer assets, especially as more individuals engage in cashless transactions through electronic payment methods such as debit and credit cards.

Malik proposes a framework that utilizes biometric retina recognition for Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, arguing that it offers enhanced security compared to existing methods. Her framework aims to leverage the unique digital identity of each customer during the onboarding process, thereby reducing the risk of digital identity theft. Furthermore, she suggests that retinal biometric recognition could eventually be integrated into ATMs to mitigate various fraud risks, including cash trapping, card skimming, and other security threats.

In summary, Ayushi Malik's work reflects a strong commitment to advancing cybersecurity in the banking sector through innovative biometric solutions, contributing to both academic knowledge and practical applications in the field.
