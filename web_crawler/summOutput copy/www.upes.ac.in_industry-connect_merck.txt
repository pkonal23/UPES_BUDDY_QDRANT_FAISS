Merck Life Science Private Limited, a prominent science and technology company based in Darmstadt, Germany, has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES). This collaboration aims to enhance scientific skill development for UPES students through hands-on training opportunities.

The training sessions will be conducted at either the Merck High-Skill Development Centre located in Chandigarh or the Merck Innovation Lab in Bangalore. The High-Skill Development Centre was established through a partnership between Merck and CSIR-IMTech, which is the leading research and development laboratory under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), operating under the Ministry of Science and Technology.

This initiative will provide UPES students with direct subject matter guidance and practical experience in the field of Life Sciences, thereby equipping them with essential skills for their future careers in science and technology.
