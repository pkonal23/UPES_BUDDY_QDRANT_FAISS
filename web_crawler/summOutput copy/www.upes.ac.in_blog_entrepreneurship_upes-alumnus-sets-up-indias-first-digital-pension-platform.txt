**Summary of PensionBox and Its Founding Story**

PensionBox, founded in 2021 by Kuldeep Parashar, is India’s first digital pension platform aimed at transforming retirement planning for millions of non-government workers. The platform has quickly gained traction, boasting over 500 subscribers within months of its launch, thanks to a community of co-creators who provide feedback to refine the product before its public release.

Motivated by the realization that many Indians, including his own parents, lack a concrete pension plan, Kuldeep and his brother Shivam initially developed a retirement plan for their family. This experience highlighted a broader issue affecting millions of Indians who remain dependent on their families in old age. Kuldeep’s vision for PensionBox is to empower individuals to take charge of their retirement planning, ensuring financial independence during their vulnerable years.

PensionBox is a cloud-based, AI-enabled platform that offers a flexible, transparent, and secure method for retirement planning. It allows users to manage their savings through a paperless system, enabling them to adjust their contributions without penalties. The platform is designed to cater to the unique needs of individuals, regardless of their retirement age, location, or profession.

Kuldeep credits the UPES Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (UCIE) for supporting his start-up journey. He expressed gratitude for the mentorship and resources provided by UPES, which helped him refine his vision and connect with strategic partners.

Additionally, the UPES community fosters various entrepreneurial ventures, including W&W Organics, co-founded by Aakansha Simra, which offers organic soap solutions, and other student-led initiatives focusing on diverse markets such as anime merchandise and period pain relief products.

PensionBox aims to address the impending challenge of retirement savings in India, projecting that by 2050, the elderly population will reach 340 million without adequate financial preparation. The platform promotes co-creation, engaging users in the development process to better meet their needs.
