Dr. Sambit Prasanajit Naik is a prominent scientist specializing in Active Tectonics, Paleoseismology, and Earthquake Hazard Estimation. He possesses over a decade of international experience across Mexico, the USA, and South Korea, and has earned his Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. Dr. Naik's research focuses on several key areas, including Active Fault Mapping, Paleoseismic Investigations, and earthquake hazard estimation across various tectonic environments, such as intraplate, volcanic, and plate boundary regions. He employs advanced geophysical tools like Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), seismic downhole techniques, and Multi-Channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) for shallow subsurface investigations. Additionally, he evaluates Soil Liquefaction Potential through both experimental and analytical methods, exploring mitigation strategies using sustainable materials like activated carbon.

Dr. Naik has received numerous accolades, including the prestigious TWAS-UNESCO Fellowship for his innovative research on Active Faults and Paleoseismology. His career includes significant roles, such as Leading Researcher at the Active Fault and Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Research Institute in South Korea, where he led critical projects on seismic risk mitigation. He has also served as a Research Professor and Scientist at UNAM Mexico and IIT Kanpur, respectively. His scholarly contributions include over 50 papers published in SCI journals and conferences, along with several book chapters. He is actively involved in editorial duties, serving as a guest editor for a special issue in Remote Sensing and as an editor board member of Discover Geoscience.

Dr. Naik's teaching philosophy emphasizes a practical, student-centered approach that fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. He integrates theoretical knowledge with practical applications, ensuring students are well-equipped for academic and professional success in geosciences. His courses cover topics such as Indian Stratigraphy, Metamorphic Petrology, Geochemistry, and Geophysics, and he emphasizes experiential learning through fieldwork and the use of modern geological software.
