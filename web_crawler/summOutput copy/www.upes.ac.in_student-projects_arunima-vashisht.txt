Arunima Vashisht, a B.Des. student specializing in Interior & Retail Space Design from the 2018-22 batch, has successfully completed a project focused on designing a Work from Home Space POD. This project is a response to the increasing number of remote workers in tier 1 and tier 2 cities, addressing their diverse needs for work, personal life, and wellness.

The design specifically targets a wide demographic, ranging from teenagers to middle-aged professionals who appreciate unique and aspirational products. The Work from Home Space POD concept repurposes traditional office pods, adapting them to meet post-Covid safety standards while also reflecting the evolving trends in workplace environments.

The project was developed under the mentorship of a professor from the School of Design, emphasizing the importance of dedicated personal spaces for remote workers, especially in light of challenges such as privacy, interruptions, and the need for focus that have emerged during the pandemic. Arunima's initiative highlights the necessity for innovative solutions to support the changing dynamics of work-from-home arrangements.
