Dr. Laxmi Kirola, a faculty member at the UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology, has recently achieved a significant milestone by securing a grant from the Department of Science and Technology - Science and Engineering Research Board (DST-SERB) under the TARE Scheme. This grant is aimed at supporting her research project titled "Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Functional Characterizations of Novel Identified Disease Causal Gene(s)/Variant(s) in Families with Juvenile Parkinson’s Disease." The project is being guided by Dr. Sujata Mohanty, a Professor at the AIIMS Stem Cell Facility in Delhi.

The primary goal of Dr. Kirola's research is to enhance the understanding of juvenile Parkinson’s disease through innovative stem cell research methodologies. This work is poised to make significant contributions to medical science and provide new hope for individuals affected by this condition.

Congratulations are extended to Dr. Kirola and her team for their pioneering efforts in this vital area of research.
