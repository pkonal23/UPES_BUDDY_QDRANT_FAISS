The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in India was established by the All-India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) in 1994 under section 10(u) of the AICTE Act. Its primary purpose is to assess and enhance the programmatic quality of educational institutions. As of January 7, 2010, NBA operates as an independent and autonomous authority focused on ensuring the quality and relevance of technical education across various professional and technical disciplines. These disciplines include engineering, technology, management, architecture, pharmacy, and hotel management and catering technology. The NBA plays a crucial role in maintaining and improving educational standards in these fields through its accreditation processes.
