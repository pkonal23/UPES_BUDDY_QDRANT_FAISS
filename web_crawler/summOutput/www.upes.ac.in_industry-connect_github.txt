2. **Challenges and Hackathons**: Regularly organized events focused on relevant themes and problem areas to engage students and teachers in practical coding experiences.

3. **Mentorship Programs**: Providing access to global experts who will mentor teachers and students on coding and open-source software development trends and practices.

4. **GitHub Campus Program**: UPES will receive a complimentary package that includes technical tools, faculty training, and support for developing technical student communities on campus.

5. **GitHub Student Developer Pack**: This initiative offers students free access to over 100 industry-leading software development tools.

6. **Access to GitHub Enterprise**: Every department within UPES will have free access to both GitHub Enterprise Server and GitHub Enterprise Cloud as part of the GitHub Campus Program.

These efforts aim to support start-ups and foster entrepreneurship development initiatives within the educational framework, ultimately preparing students for successful careers in technology.
