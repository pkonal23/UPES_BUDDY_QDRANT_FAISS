The University of Central Lancashire, represented by Lawrence Lu, and the Bidholi Campus of UPES, under the leadership of Dean Phani Tetali, hosted the India HCI 2023 conference from November 23 to 25, 2023. This premier event, organized by the School of Design (SOD) at UPES Dehradun, served as a significant platform for researchers, practitioners, and students to exchange insights and advancements in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The conference theme, “HCI for Enabling Creativity,” aimed to foster dialogues and discussions that bridge the gap between creativity and HCI.

Key highlights of the conference included various tracks such as Arts, Women in HCI, and Start-Up, alongside thought-provoking panel discussions and keynote sessions featuring prominent figures like Prof. Venkatesh Rajamanickam, Prof. Janet Read from the iHUB and HCI Foundation at IIT Mandi, and Dr. Balvinder Singh. The event also showcased industry case studies, presentations, and a Student Research Consortium, encouraging innovative ideas and research that push the boundaries of HCI.

The School Marketing Team collaborated with marketing interns to create a Daily Posting schedule to promote the event on social media, particularly through Instagram. They shared highlights, stories, and live coverage from the event, ensuring that brand guidelines were adhered to in all posts. This included interactions with keynote speakers and presentations from student consortia.

The conference has built a robust 14-year legacy, significantly contributing to the advancement of Indian HCI on a global scale, with high publication standards maintained through the ACM Digital Library and SCOPUS indexed database.
