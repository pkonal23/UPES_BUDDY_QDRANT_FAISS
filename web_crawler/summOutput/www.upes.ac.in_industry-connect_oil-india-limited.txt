UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies) has partnered with Oil India Limited (OIL), a government enterprise under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, to engage in collaborative research focused on petroleum exploration and the use of bio-surfactant producing microbes for enhanced oil recovery. This initiative aims to leverage the expertise of OIL in the field to benefit students of the UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology (SoHST). As part of the collaboration, experts from OIL will also conduct guest lectures for SoHST students, facilitating knowledge transfer and industry connection. 

OIL is recognized as a leading national oil company in India, specializing in the exploration, development, and production of crude oil and natural gas, making it the second-largest government-owned hydrocarbon explorer and producer in the country.
