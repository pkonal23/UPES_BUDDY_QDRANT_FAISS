Dr. Tirumala Rao Kotni is an Assistant Professor in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) in Dehradun. His academic journey includes a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from M.V.G.R. College of Engineering affiliated with J.N.T.U Hyderabad, followed by an M.Tech in Chemical Engineering from NIT Trichy, Tamil Nadu. He completed his Ph.D. at IIT Delhi, where his research focused on dewetting in thin liquid films, particularly how viscosity variations based on film thickness affect this phenomenon. His work involved numerical simulations in both 2D and 3D to explore the physical mechanisms of dewetting on solid surfaces.

Prior to his current position, Dr. Kotni worked as a Research Associate at IIT Delhi, where he researched protein aggregation using Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations, emphasizing the dynamics of protein aggregation and aggregation kinetics on a 2D hexagonal lattice.

Dr. Kotni's teaching philosophy emphasizes education and mentorship, aiming to empower students to achieve their goals and excel academically. He actively supports students in their projects, providing guidance to help them overcome challenges.

His research interests are diverse and include:
- Mathematical Modeling and Simulation
- Dewetting and Phase Separation of thin liquid films
- Interface Science
- Electrospinning of Nano Fibers
