**Research Overview:**
Snigdha Mishra, a faculty member at the School of Health Sciences & Technology, has published a significant research paper that explores the role of seminal protein, Sex Peptide (SP), in Drosophila melanogaster, which serves as an effective alternative model to traditional vertebrate studies. The study investigates how SP interacts with essential female factors to regulate post-mating behaviors in females, ultimately enhancing their reproductive success. 

Key findings from the research indicate that female contributions are vital in managing the levels of SP associated with sperm in various storage sites, challenging the notion that the SP-regulated processes are predominantly male-driven. This work adds valuable insights to the limited existing data on female involvement in reproductive processes.

**Research Context:**
- The study stems from Snigdha Mishra's post-doctoral research conducted in Mariana F. Wolfner's laboratory at Cornell University.

This achievement reflects the ongoing research efforts and contributions of faculty members to the scientific community, particularly in understanding complex reproductive mechanisms in model organisms.
