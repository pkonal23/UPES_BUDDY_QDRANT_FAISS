Somnath Banerjee serves on the Advisory Board of the School of Engineering and has a longstanding career with Halliburton in Norway, where he has been employed for over 30 years within the Upstream Oil and Gas Industry on a global scale. His recent work has focused on the acceleration of Remote Operations due to the Covid crisis, where he has been involved in developing hardware and processes for implementation offshore in Norway. His efforts encompass a wide range of functions including Monitoring, Controlling, Collaborating, and Automating, utilizing the latest technologies.

Banerjee previously spent nearly two years at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) as an Industry Fellow, where he taught various courses related to Petroleum Engineering. He also served as the Faculty Advisor for the UPES Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Student Chapter during the 2017-2018 academic year. Although he was pursuing a PhD at UPES, he had to discontinue his studies in 2018 to assist with a startup initiative for his previous company in Norway. His experience at UPES provided him with insights into academic processes, including the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) and PhD programs, and he found great satisfaction in teaching the younger generation. He maintains connections with many of his former students through platforms like WhatsApp and LinkedIn.

Banerjee holds a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS, Pilani. Throughout his extensive international oil field career, he has acquired knowledge across various engineering disciplines, although his primary expertise lies in the Wireline and Formation Evaluation domain. Within Halliburton, he has contributed to Special Projects, Investigations, Technical Training, and the global selection and development of the workforce.
