The content presents a message from Dr. Ram Sharma, the Vice-Chancellor of UPES, aimed at inspiring students as they embark on their educational journey. It begins with a reference to the Syadvada philosophy in Jainism, illustrated through the parable of "The Elephant and the Blind Men," which emphasizes the importance of understanding truth from multiple perspectives and the need for open-mindedness and receptiveness to differing opinions.

Dr. Sharma encourages students to recognize their infinite potential, quoting the Chhandogya Upanishadâ€™s phrase "Tat Tvam Asi" (Thou art That), suggesting that individuals are part of a greater whole and must realize their true potential across various fields. He highlights that achieving this potential requires hard work and effort, reminding students that their actions have consequences and that they should take responsibility for their decisions.

He shares a story of a dialogue between Buddha and his disciple Ananda, where Buddha advises Ananda to "Aatmadipo Bhav," meaning to become his own light. This serves as a reminder that self-belief can empower individuals to make a significant impact on the world. Dr. Sharma stresses that learning is a lifelong endeavor, encouraging students to embrace new opportunities regardless of age.

Additionally, he recounts a story from Hermann Hesse's "Siddhartha," where Siddhartha's encounter with Buddha highlights the importance of humility and the prudent use of intelligence. Buddha's warning against excessive cleverness serves as a lesson to maintain humility and a constant thirst for knowledge.

In conclusion, Dr. Sharma warmly welcomes students to their journey of learning, urging them to embrace opportunities, work diligently, and always believe in themselves.
