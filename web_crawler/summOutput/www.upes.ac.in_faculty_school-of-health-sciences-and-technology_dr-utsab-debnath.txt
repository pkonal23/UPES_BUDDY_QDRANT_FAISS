Dr. Debnath has received notable awards, including the 'National Postdoctoral Fellowship' under the 'DST-Young Scientist Scheme' of the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), New Delhi, in 2017, and a 'Direct Senior Research Fellowship' from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, in 2011. He has also qualified for the Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test (GPAT) conducted by AICTE and has served as a principal investigator for an extramural research project.

In terms of teaching philosophy, Dr. Debnath advocates for modern teaching methods that enhance effective learning. He employs a "Constructivism framework" to foster active learning, utilizing PowerPoint presentations and high-quality audio-visual materials to engage students. He emphasizes problem-solving through group discussions and regular assessments to gauge students' understanding.
