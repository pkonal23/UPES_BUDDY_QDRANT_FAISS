The National Education Policy 2020 highlights the importance of research and innovation in academia, advocating for increased financial support for academic research initiatives. This focus is reflected in various emerging engineering fields and career opportunities for graduates, particularly in areas such as aerospace, chemical, and energy engineering.

Aerospace engineering, which includes aeronautical and astronautical engineering, is evolving with new technologies and innovations. The demand for skilled professionals in this field is growing, especially as the industry adapts to advancements such as 5G technology, which is projected to significantly impact various sectors globally.

For chemical engineering graduates, the field offers numerous career paths. One prominent role is that of an analytical chemist, involved in analyzing chemical properties and compounds using techniques like mass spectrometry and chromatography. The B.Tech. Chemical Engineering program, particularly with specializations in Energy Systems & Storage, Digitalization of Process Technology, Refining & Petrochemicals, and Clean Energy Technologies, equips students with essential skills and knowledge to excel in these sectors. The program typically spans four years and combines theoretical learning with practical training and research opportunities.

Sustainable engineering is becoming increasingly relevant, with energy engineering graduates taking on roles such as solar energy system engineers and project managers. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) is transforming the automotive industry, with sales in India experiencing a remarkable 42% increase, indicating a shift towards greener transportation solutions. Additionally, hydrogen-powered vehicles are emerging as a viable alternative to EVs, driven by environmental concerns and new subsidies.

The UPES School of Engineering is at the forefront of these developments, offering students experiential learning through industrial tours and visits to organizations such as ISRO and Bharat Dynamics Limited. The school emphasizes the importance of innovative thinking and problem-solving skills in engineering, as highlighted by notable figures such as Anand Kumar of ‘Super 30’ fame, who shares insights on the skills necessary for success in engineering.

As students approach graduation, they face critical decisions regarding their future paths, such as choosing between pursuing an M.Tech. or an MBA. The blog aims to guide students through the diverse opportunities available in chemical engineering and related fields, emphasizing the importance of aligning career choices with personal passions and industry trends.
