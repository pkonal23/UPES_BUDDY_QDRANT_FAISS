Dr. Devendra Saini, an esteemed faculty member at the School of Advanced Engineering, has developed a novel algorithm aimed at significantly improving the detection of faults in electric traction lines for Indian Railways and DMRC metro services. This algorithm addresses the limitations of conventional fault detection methods, which typically identify fault locations within a radius of 0.5 to 6 kilometers, requiring up to five hours for personnel to locate the faults accurately, despite the fault clearance time being only 15-20 minutes.

The newly proposed algorithm enhances fault location accuracy to within a 200-meter radius and drastically reduces the time required for human personnel to pinpoint faults. Notably, it can calculate fault distances without relying on the software-controlled module of the Distance Protection Relay (DPR). The algorithm was first implemented on a trial basis in 2018, and by 2019, it had become an integral part of the fault detection system. A practical trial was conducted at the Traction Power Control Room in the Trivandrum Division of Indian Railways, covering a 35 km feeding sector (Eraniel to Balaramapuram), where impedance charts were created for every 100-meter segment of the electrical traction line.

The findings from this research have been published in reputable journals, including IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, IEEE Access, and IETE Journal of Research. Dr. Saini, along with co-investigator Dr. Ravi Kumaran Nair, Director of RDSO, Lucknow, expressed gratitude to the Southern Railway administration for their support in conducting this vital research, which aims to reduce train delays caused by electrical faultsâ€”a situation that can have significant repercussions on the country's GDP.
