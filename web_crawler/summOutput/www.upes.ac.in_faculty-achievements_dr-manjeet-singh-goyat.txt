Dr. Manjeet Singh Goyat has made significant achievements in the field of nanocomposites research, particularly focusing on enhancing carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. He has been awarded a grant of approximately INR 26 Lakhs from the Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the Science & Engineering Research Board (SERB) for a project that aims to address the delamination and weak polymer-fiber interface issues in CFRP composites using self-entangled CNT/ZnO tetrapod-based fillers.

In addition, Dr. Goyat has also received the DST SERB-SIRE Fellowship in 2023 for his project on self-entangled CNT/t-ZnO network reinforced high-performance 3D epoxy nanocomposites, which is supported by a grant of around INR 16 Lakhs from DST SERB.

These achievements highlight Dr. Goyat's contributions to advancing nanocomposite technologies, underlining his role in the School of Advanced Engineering. The projects funded through the DST SERB-SURE and SERB-SIRE grants emphasize the importance of innovative research in the field of materials science.
