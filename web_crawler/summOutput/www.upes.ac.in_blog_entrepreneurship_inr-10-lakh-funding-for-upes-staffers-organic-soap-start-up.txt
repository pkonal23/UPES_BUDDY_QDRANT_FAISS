**W&W Organics Overview**

W&W Organics is a start-up founded by Aakansha Simra, a lab technician at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), along with her friend Pratiksha. The name of the venture, "W&W Organics," stands for "Wait and Wishes Organics," reflecting the meanings of the founders' names—Aakansha meaning 'Wish' and Pratiksha meaning 'Wait.' The team consists of three members: Aakansha oversees production, Pratiksha manages marketing, and Vaibhav Bhatt, the Director, handles scaling and sales.

**Inception and Product Development**

The idea for W&W Organics emerged when Aakansha visited Pratiksha’s farmhouse in Dehradun, where she was inspired by the extensive cultivation of various crops. This led to the exploration of soap-making using natural ingredients derived from plants and flowers. After extensive research and experimentation, they developed an organic soap formulation that is gentle on the skin, addressing Aakansha's personal struggle with sensitive skin and the adverse effects of chemical-laden products.

**Support from UPES and Runway Incubator**

Aakansha expressed gratitude for the opportunities provided by UPES, which fosters creativity and personal growth. She highlighted the support received from Runway, UPES's start-up incubator, where she received assistance in preparing her pitch deck, logo design, and financial advice from team members like Mr. Vaibhav Mishra and Mr. Mohit Nagpal. 

**Environmental Focus and Product Launch**

W&W Organics aims to produce environmentally-friendly soap bars, packaged in paper instead of plastic, aligning with their motto "By nature, for nature." Aakansha emphasizes the need to reduce plastic waste associated with liquid soap packaging, which contributes to a larger carbon footprint. The product line will cater to men, women, and children, ensuring that all soaps are fully organic and made from natural ingredients.
