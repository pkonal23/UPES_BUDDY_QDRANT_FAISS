FitBread is a food startup that specializes in producing nutritious and tasty whole wheat bread without preservatives or artificial additives. Founded by UPES alumni Aryan Singh, Akshit Saxena, and Aditya Kashyap, FitBread aims to fill a gap in the Indian bread market, which has seen little innovation over the past decade. Most commercially available bread products contain a significant amount of maida (refined flour) and additives, whereas FitBread prides itself on using 100% whole wheat grain atta and locally sourced ingredients, including superfoods.

The startup is incubated at the UPES Council for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (UCIE) and has garnered positive consumer feedback since its inception in 2021. The founders have a strong commitment to community empowerment, hiring women from local areas in Uttarakhand for the bread-making process and providing them with additional bakery skills training. This initiative not only supports local economies but also promotes financial independence among these women.

FitBread offers its products in six different flavors, all made from common household ingredients. Each loaf is crafted with a unique blend of whole wheat atta, flax seeds, oats, and amaranth seeds, ensuring that the grains are integrated throughout the loaf rather than just on the crust, which is a common issue with other brands.

The founders are also focused on expanding their operations to other states and educating the public about health and wellness. They believe in creating sustainable growth opportunities for local businesses while maintaining a connection to their roots.
