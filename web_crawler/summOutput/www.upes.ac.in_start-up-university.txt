Runway Incubator, established in 2021 as part of UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies), is a prominent Start-up Incubator Program aimed at nurturing both university-affiliated and external startups. The initiative focuses on transforming innovative ideas into viable, scalable businesses, empowering students to become job creators rather than mere job seekers. Since its inception, Runway has successfully incubated over 250 startups and facilitated the raising of more than INR 20 crore in funding. 

Recently, Runway launched its fourth cohort, Cohort 4.0, which includes 100 pre-incubated startups. Additionally, UPES has been awarded an INR 5 crore grant under the NIDHI i-TBI (Inclusive-Tech Business Incubator) scheme to further enhance its support for startups.

Runway emphasizes mentorship as a critical component of its program. It connects budding entrepreneurs with experienced mentors, including faculty, alumni, industry experts, and successful entrepreneurs. The mentorship structure includes regular meetings, discussions, and feedback sessions where insights and advice are shared. Mentoring can be customized to meet the specific needs of startups, offering one-on-one sessions, group discussions, or a combination of both, depending on the startup's stage of development and the challenges it faces.
