Dr. D.P. Singh is an accomplished academic with a strong background in Experimental Nuclear Physics. He earned his Ph.D. in 2010 from the Department of Physics at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Aligarh, in collaboration with the Inter University Accelerator Centre (IUAC) in New Delhi. His doctoral thesis focused on "Investigation of the Role of Break-up Processes in Heavy Ion Reactions Below 7 MeV/Nucleon." Prior to this, he completed his M.Phil. in 2003, studying the "Analysis of Fractional Quantum Hall Effect" at the Institute of Basic Sciences, Khandari, Agra.

Dr. Singh has been actively involved in teaching and research across various institutions since completing his Ph.D. He has successfully completed two funded research projects sanctioned by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) under the Department of Science and Technology (DST) of the Government of India. He has also supervised one Ph.D. student and has an impressive publication record, with over 75 research articles in reputable national and international journals and more than 100 presentations at conferences and symposia. Dr. Singh is a Life Member of the Indian Physics Association (IPA) and the Indian Association of Physics Teachers (IAPT).

His research interests are centered around Nuclear Reaction Mechanisms, particularly involving pre-equilibrium emission, fusion, and fission reactions through light and heavy ion interactions at energies near and above the Coulomb barrier (below 10 MeV/nucleon). He is also focused on Surface Activity Measurements using Thin Layer Activation techniques, which provide alternatives to conventional measurement methods. Additionally, he is involved in the production of radionuclides for applications in nuclear medicine, addressing the high demand for these isotopes.

Dr. Singh has held various academic positions, including Young Scientist at AMU from July 2012 to November 2014, and guest faculty roles at several institutions. He has taught a wide range of physics courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels, including nuclear and particle physics, classical mechanics, and engineering physics. His teaching philosophy emphasizes a collaborative and respectful learning environment, utilizing formal lectures combined with discussion sessions to enhance students' understanding and engagement.

In terms of scholarly activities, he has been involved in research experiments at IUAC New Delhi and has received beam time for his projects. His research contributions include five scientific/technical reports and significant citation metrics, with over 1500 citations and an h-index of 20/38.

Dr. Singh's notable research grants include:
- "Investigation of fusion-fission reaction dynamics in heavy ion interactions" funded by DST-SERB, New Delhi (2018-2022).
- "Investigation of heavy ion reactions at low energies: Energy and mass asymmetry dependence of incomplete fusion" sanctioned by DST, New Delhi (2012-2015).
