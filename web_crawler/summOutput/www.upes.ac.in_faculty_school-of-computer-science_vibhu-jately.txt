Dr. Vibhu Jately, an IEEE Senior Member since 2022, is an Assistant Professor (Selection Grade) at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), where he has been employed since October 2021. He holds a Ph.D. from G. B. Pant University, Pantnagar, India, and has accumulated over eight years of teaching and research experience. His professional journey includes working as an Assistant Professor under the United Nations Development Program at Wollo University in Ethiopia from October 2017 to June 2019, and as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the MCAST Energy Research Group in Malta, where he led European H2020 projects for two years.

Dr. Jately's research interests focus on power electronics applications in renewable energy systems, particularly in the context of grid integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems. He has developed various control strategies for integrating distributed energy resources and employs AI techniques for microgrid planning, as well as swarm intelligence methods in PV applications. His scholarly contributions include over sixteen high-quality publications in SCI/SCIE journals, two utility patents, and the editorial work on two books relating to AI, Blockchain, and IoT applications in sustainable energy.

In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Dr. Jately serves as a lead trainer for TATA Power Industry Professionals on “Energy Storage Systems & Grid Integration” at UPES and is a member of the School of Advanced Engineering Task Force at the university. He has also contributed to the Naan Mudhalvan Massive Upskilling Program at Anna University as a resource person for Coursera, focusing on Electric Systems for E-mobility.

Dr. Jately emphasizes a teaching philosophy that values inquiry and real-world relevance, believing that effective teaching intertwines with robust research. He encourages students to engage actively with the material, introducing concepts through intuition and physical reasoning rather than purely mathematical approaches.
