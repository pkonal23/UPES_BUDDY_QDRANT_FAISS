Dr. Anil Kumar is an Associate Professor at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) with a robust background in Thermal Engineering. Prior to his current role, he served as an Assistant Professor at Shoolini University and completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Kyungpook National University in South Korea from 2013 to 2015. Dr. Kumar holds a Ph.D. in Thermal Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (2013), and an M.Tech in Thermal Engineering from Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow (2009).

His research interests encompass a wide range of topics, including heat transfer, the analysis of nanofluid flow in heat exchangers, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and exergy analysis of solar thermal systems. He is particularly focused on optimizing heat exchanger performance through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methodologies, as well as fuzzy logic techniques. Dr. Kumar has authored over fifty research papers in prestigious national and international journals, contributed to a book chapter, and has actively participated in various conferences and workshops, delivering numerous lectures.

In terms of teaching, Dr. Kumar has over ten years of experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, instructing courses such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, Energy Engineering, Solar Thermal Technology, Advanced Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, Engineering Thermodynamics, and Automobile Engineering. His teaching philosophy emphasizes recognizing each student's unique learning style and potential, fostering their confidence, and tailoring instructional methods to enhance their educational experience.

Dr. Kumar has also engaged in significant research collaborations, focusing on the experimental evaluation of diesel blends mixed with municipal plastic waste pyrolysis oil, the emission characteristics of compression ignition engines, and enhancing heat transfer using innovative solar heat collector designs. He has successfully guided four Ph.D. students as a supervisor and two as a co-supervisor, further contributing to the academic community.

His noteworthy achievements include receiving a post-doctoral grant from the Machinery Research Centre at Kyungpook National University and a fellowship from the Ministry of Human Resource Development during his doctoral studies. He has also served as a co-principal investigator on a HIMCOST-funded project aimed at improving the efficiency of packed bed solar thermal energy storage systems.
