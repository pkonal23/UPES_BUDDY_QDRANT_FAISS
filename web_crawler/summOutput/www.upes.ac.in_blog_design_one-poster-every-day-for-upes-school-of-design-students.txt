A project by UPES School of Design students, mentored by experts from IBM and IKEA, has garnered multiple accolades, including the ‘CII Young Designer Award 2022’, the D’source DIC-BHU Award from IIT Bombay, and an honorable mention at the Student Service Design Challenge 2022 during Barcelona Design Week. 

Student Pratishtha Nautiyal reflected on her experience with a daily poster design challenge, stating that it pushed her creative boundaries and enhanced her skills in researching and designing effective posters. The challenge aimed to convey specific messages to target audiences through ideation, analysis, and visual interpretation, utilizing rapid and non-verbal mental processes. 

The poster project lasted six weeks, focusing on themes like cyberbullying and trolling, encouraging students to explore creativity within constraints. Fellow student Abhishek Kumar described the experience as both challenging and rewarding, emphasizing the importance of thinking outside the box and experimenting with new ideas. 

Kavya Jayaprakash, another student, secured a four-and-a-half-month paid internship with Accenture while on a semester exchange program in France, showcasing the practical opportunities available for design students. 

The UPES School of Design emphasizes the diverse and innovative nature of a Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) education, preparing students for various careers in design. The curriculum includes a focus on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design, highlighting the importance of aesthetics and effective communication in product design. 

Students engaged in the poster design project adopted different themes each day, such as Minimal Mondays and Typographic Tuesdays, which allowed them to explore a wide range of styles and techniques. Saloni Dugar, another second-year graphic design student, noted the value of peer feedback in refining their work and fostering a professional critique environment. 

The article concludes with a call for aspiring designers to consider pursuing a Master of Design (M.Des.) degree to elevate their careers, alongside an invitation to subscribe to UPES blogs for further insights and updates on design education.
