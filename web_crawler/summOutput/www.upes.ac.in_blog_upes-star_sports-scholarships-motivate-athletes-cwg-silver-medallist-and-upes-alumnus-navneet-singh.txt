A food start-up incubated at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) in Dehradun is focused on empowering local communities. This initiative aligns with UPES's broader commitment to fostering a thriving sports culture and enhancing educational opportunities for deserving individuals. As part of this effort, UPES has introduced new sports scholarships for the academic year 2022-23, aimed at supporting students who excel in sports while pursuing their education.

These scholarships are contingent upon academic eligibility and the requirement that recipients continue participating in sports as part of the UPES team. Dr. Sunil Rai, Vice Chancellor of UPES, emphasized the university's mission to promote education for all, highlighting the launch of Project Vijay, which was announced in the presence of Uttarakhand's Chief Minister, Shri Pushkar Singh Dhami. The initiative will allocate 50 sports scholarships across various disciplines, including Cricket, Football, Athletics, Basketball, Volleyball, Table Tennis, Badminton, Shooting, and Chess.

The scholarships, which cover 35% to 100% of tuition fees based on the candidate's achievements and representation in national and international sports, aim to alleviate financial burdens, allowing athletes to concentrate on their training and studies. UPES alumnus Navneet Singh, a Commonwealth Games silver medallist, expressed pride in the university's initiative, noting that scholarships significantly boost the morale of aspiring athletes and help them pursue sports professionally.

The announcement comes at a time when India is striving to enhance its sporting infrastructure and aims to be recognized as a leading sports nation by 2047. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has articulated a vision for India to rank among the top five countries in sports by the centenary of independence, emphasizing the need for improved facilities, coaching, and support for athletes.
