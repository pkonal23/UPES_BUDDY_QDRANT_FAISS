Jenisha Neupane, a final-semester LL.M. student from Nepal, expressed her joy at the event, stating that it was a "big hit" as attendees enjoyed local Nepalese snacks, particularly Wai Wai Sadeko, with many returning for multiple servings. Anusha Mirza, a third-year Product Design student from UAE, served Chicken Shawarma and Hummus, attracting long queues of eager visitors. PhD scholar Armel M Nganda from Cameroon prepared traditional dishes like Ndoleh and Chicken Sauce with Fried Potatoes, highlighting the similarities he found between Indian and Cameroonian cuisines.

Dr. Sheetal Khanka, Deputy Director of the Department of International Affairs (DIA) at UPES, emphasized that the festival was designed to showcase culinary excellence and promote cultural unity. The event received overwhelmingly positive feedback, leading the DIA to consider making it a biannual occurrence.

Attendees enjoyed a diverse array of dishes, including Bhutan’s Kewa Datshi, Ghana’s Swahili Buns, South Sudan’s Cassava Leaves, and Gambia’s Chu Yassa.

Overall, the event was celebrated as a significant opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to connect and appreciate the rich diversity present at UPES.
