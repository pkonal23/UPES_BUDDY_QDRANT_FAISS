**Karwaan: The Heritage Exploration Overview**

Founded in 2019, Karwaan: The Heritage Exploration is an initiative aimed at fostering conversations surrounding histories, heritages, and cultures, with a focus on bridging the divide between academic research and public understanding. It has quickly established itself as one of India's most active history collectives, engaging the general public in meaningful dialogue about cultural and historical narratives.

**Faculty Achievements**

Sudha Tiwari, a faculty member at the School of Liberal Studies and Media, has made significant contributions to this initiative. In July 2022, she presented her research titled "The NFDC, New Indian Cinema, and the Contemporary Discourses on 'Good Cinema' (1960s to 1990s)" during an online talk organized by Karwaan. This presentation is part of her forthcoming book with Routledge, which delves into the history of the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) and the New Cinema movement in India. 

The talk highlighted the evolution of Indian cinema and its cultural implications, marking an important contribution to the discourse on film and heritage in the country.
