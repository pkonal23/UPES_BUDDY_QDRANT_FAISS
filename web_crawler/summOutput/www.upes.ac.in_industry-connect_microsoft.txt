UPES has formed a collaboration with Microsoft that spans various interdisciplinary fields, including B.Tech. and M.Tech. programs in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Computer Science Engineering, B.Pharmacy, MBA in Analytics, as well as B.Design and M.Design programs. A significant outcome of this partnership is the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab at UPES, which provides students with access to the Intelligent Cloud Hub (ICH) program. Upon completion of the program, students will receive certificates.

The collaboration enhances the learning experience for UPES students by offering state-of-the-art infrastructure, a comprehensive curriculum, and access to cloud and AI services, along with developer support. Students are encouraged to engage in regional and national hackathons, fostering practical experience and innovation.

Additionally, Microsoft will provide training for UPES faculty members, ensuring that programs will cover critical topics such as Azure software, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Web Development, and Data Sciences. This initiative aims to elevate the educational standards and industry readiness of UPES students.
