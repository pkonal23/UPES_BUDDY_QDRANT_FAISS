The CNC Engraver Laser Cutter Machine is a precision device capable of creating 2 mm holes with high accuracy. It is designed to produce clean cuts, which reduces the need for further post-processing operations. This non-contact laser cutting technology is particularly beneficial for machining components in the medical industry, where precision is crucial.

This project was conducted by Krishna, a B.Tech. student specializing in Electronics & Computer Engineering from the 2022-26 batch. The project focused on the development of the CNC Engraver Laser Cutter Machine, which utilizes a high-powered laser beam to mark, cut, or engrave materials, allowing for the creation of custom shapes.

The machine minimizes the reliance on multiple cutting tools or custom tools, streamlining the process compared to traditional CNC routers and milling machines.
