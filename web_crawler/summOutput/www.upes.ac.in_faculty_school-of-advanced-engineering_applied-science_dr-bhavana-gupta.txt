Dr. Bhavana Gupta is an Associate Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering, recognized for her contributions to material design aimed at solving environmental and energy-related challenges. Her research focuses on the synthesis of functional materials, exploring their properties in both pure and modified forms, and addressing issues related to cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and efficiency. Notably, during her postdoctoral research in France, she achieved the first proof-of-principle demonstration of wireless actuation in conducting polymers.

Dr. Gupta has amassed eight years of international research experience at prestigious institutions and is well-equipped to establish advanced research facilities and foster collaborations between Indian and foreign institutes. Her expertise encompasses various instrumental techniques, including conventional and bipolar electrochemistry, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electrochemical microscopy. Her research applications span energy storage, hydrogen generation, CO2 fixation, and soft robotics.

In terms of her academic background, Dr. Gupta earned her PhD from the Indian Institute of Technology, BHU, in 2013, and participated in the JENESYS program at Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan, during her doctoral studies. Following her PhD, she was awarded the Blaustein postdoctoral scholarship, which allowed her to conduct research at Ben Gurion University of Negev in Israel, and later received the IdEx postdoctoral fellowship for work at Bordeaux University in France. Additionally, she has served as an assistant professor at the Institute of Physical Chemistry in Poland and as a distinguished professor at Henan University in China. Her academic pursuits also included brief study visits to South Korea.

Dr. Gupta is passionate about teaching and believes that engaging with students enhances understanding and enthusiasm for the subject matter. She aims to integrate the latest research into her curriculum while preparing students for future challenges and promoting independent thinking. She encourages open discussions on scientific issues and strives to instill a research-oriented mindset in her students through experimental demonstrations.

Throughout her career, Dr. Gupta has published over 60 peer-reviewed articles and actively reviews for various journals and doctoral theses. She has successfully managed three scientific projects funded by agencies in India, China, and the European Union, and assists students in applying for postdoctoral research grants from international funding bodies.

Dr. Gupta teaches physical chemistry, covering topics such as thermodynamics, kinetics, and electrochemistry, with a focus on the transition from classical to statistical physical chemistry. She also teaches industrial chemistry, materials chemistry, and instrumentation.
