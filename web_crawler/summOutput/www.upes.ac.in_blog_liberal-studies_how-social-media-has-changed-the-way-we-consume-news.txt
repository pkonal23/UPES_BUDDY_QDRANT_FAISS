The landscape of news consumption has dramatically shifted over the past few decades, with social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter becoming the primary sources for news, leading to a significant decline in newspaper circulation worldwide. A survey indicated that 50% of internet users in the U.S. received news via social media before traditional media outlets. This trend is mirrored in India, where social media has also contributed to a decline in reading habits, although the country is projected to become the fifth largest newspaper market by 2026, surpassing China in readership by 2025.

The rise of social media has created a demand for professionals skilled in public relations, corporate communications, and data analytics. Mastering social media skills can provide various career opportunities for students. The UPES School of Modern Media emphasizes the importance of understanding media dynamics in the current landscape, where misinformation and fake news proliferate. The editorial team at UPES highlights the necessity for critical thinking to distinguish between fact and opinion in the post-truth era.

A two-day event organized by the student team ‘Fearless Falcons’ on August 28-29 will feature prominent leaders and students discussing these issues. The UPES School of Modern Media also offers programs that prepare students for careers in journalism and mass communication, emphasizing the need for reliable news dissemination. The challenges posed by fake news are significant, as algorithms on social media often amplify sensational content, making it essential for consumers to fact-check information before accepting it as truth.

In response to these challenges, UPES is promoting initiatives like the Srijan Social Internship program, which encourages students to engage with social sector organizations, fostering social consciousness and self-awareness. Additionally, courses in liberal arts are gaining traction in India, providing interdisciplinary education that is increasingly relevant in today's job market.
