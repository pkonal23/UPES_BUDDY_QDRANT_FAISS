The "Mazing Puzzle" is a toy concept developed by Satvik Goel, a third-year B.Des. Transportation Mobility Design student, motivated by a recognized gap in the toy market for products that promote cognitive and social development in young children. Satvik's passion for creating enjoyable yet educational items led him to design this innovative toy, which combines the fun of puzzles with the learning benefits of a maze game. 

After extensive research and development, Satvik successfully created "Mazing Puzzle," which allows children to arrange puzzle pieces in multiple configurations, encouraging exploration and the enhancement of problem-solving skills. His efforts were recognized at the Pune Design Fest 2023, where he achieved the notable first runner-up position in the Lifestyle Design category during the Battle of Project Award 2023.
