UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies) has launched tailored PhD programs specifically designed for Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel and their families, offering several key benefits. These include a 20% fee waiver and a 5% relaxation in eligibility criteria, allowing applicants with a minimum of 45% marks to qualify. The programs also provide access to live online classes and recorded sessions, ensuring a flexible and seamless learning experience.

In partnership with the Indian Air Force, UPES aims to enhance the academic and professional development of IAF personnel and their families. This collaboration includes the provision of scholarships, reserved seats, and customized academic programs. UPES Online, UPES's digital learning platform, will offer a variety of courses such as MBA, BBA, BCA, Postgraduate Programs (PGPs), and certificate courses tailored for IAF personnel and their families.

Under this partnership, UPES has committed to reserving seats and providing scholarships of up to 30% for the wards and spouses of IAF personnel enrolling in full-time undergraduate programs. Eligible programs for these scholarships include BBA, B.Tech., LL.B., B.Sc. (Hons), BA, and BA (Hons). The scholarships will be awarded based on academic performance in class 12 exams, CUET, or JEE scores.

Additionally, UPES has signed three Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the Indian Air Force to further support the educational needs of the IAF community, including serving personnel, veterans, and their families. The part-time PhD programs offered will focus on areas such as Aviation and Aeronautics Engineering, Management, Science and Technology, Legal Studies, and Logistics and Supply Chain Management, aligning with the research and development priorities of the Indian Air Force.

This initiative reflects UPES's commitment to fostering a culture of lifelong learning and growth within the IAF community, providing a holistic learning environment that caters to their unique educational needs.
