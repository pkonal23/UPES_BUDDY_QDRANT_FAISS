The B.Sc. Microbiology program offered by the UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology is designed to provide students with a comprehensive education in microbiology, preparing them for diverse career opportunities across various industries. The program spans four years, adhering to the New Education Policy (NEP), and includes multiple stages of certification: a Certificate in Microbiology after the first year, a Diploma after the second year, and a Bachelor of Science degree after the third year. Notably, students achieving a score of 75% or above can qualify for a "B.Sc. Honours by Research" in their fourth year, allowing them to undertake a 15-credit research project and potentially progress directly to a PhD without a Master's degree. Those scoring below 75% will receive a "BSc Honors Microbiology" degree.

The curriculum covers a wide range of microbiological topics, including food microbiology, environmental microbiology, medical microbiology, and agricultural microbiology, among others. Students will also engage in an industry training or internship in their final semester, earning additional credits. The program emphasizes practical learning through real-life examples, assessments, and the use of advanced facilities, including a state-of-the-art Aseptic Room and various incubators and centrifuges.

Graduates of the program are well-equipped for careers in pharmaceuticals, healthcare, biotechnology, food and beverage industries, and research organizations. The program benefits from strong industry connections, with partnerships with institutions like AIIMS, Biocon Academy, and Sun Pharma Research Centre, providing students with valuable exposure and practical learning opportunities. The dedicated placement cell at UPES actively facilitates internships and job placements for students.

To apply for the B.Sc. Microbiology program, candidates must meet the eligibility criteria, which include a minimum of 50% in X and XII with Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Math, and English as major subjects in XII. Selection is based on performance in a Personal Interview or the CUET.
