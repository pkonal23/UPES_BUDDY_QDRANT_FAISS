Subhajit Basu has made significant contributions to the field of marine microbiology, as evidenced by his recent publication in *Nature Communications*. This work is part of a collaborative study led by Marit van Erk and Olivia Metcalf from the Microsensor Research Group at the Max Planck Institute of Marine Microbiology in Bremen. The paper, titled “Reactive oxygen species affect the potential for mineralization processes in permeable intertidal flats,” can be accessed through the following link: [Nature Communications Publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-35818-4).

The study investigates the critical role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the effects of transient oxygenation on the biogeochemical processes involving carbon and iron/sulfur in the permeable intertidal sediments of the Wadden Sea. It reveals that ROS significantly influences the rates of aerobic respiration, sulfate reduction, and hydrogen accumulation, thereby playing a vital role in regulating microbial mineralization processes.

This achievement underscores the importance of Subhajit Basu's research in understanding the dynamics of marine ecosystems and their response to environmental changes.
