Debarati Pal is an Assistant Professor of Law at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), where she has been teaching since 2016. She is currently pursuing her doctoral studies at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad, under the supervision of Dr. Aruna Venkat. Her research focuses on the intersection of heritage protection and law, specifically titled "Critical Reflections on the Revitalisation of Historic Urban Landscapes: Exploring the Stakeholder Interface." Recently, she published a paper titled "A Trans-Boundary Legislative Impact Assessment of the Kailash Sacred Landscapes: Interpreting Legal Adaptation Through the Cross-Stakeholder Interface," which was released by McGill University, Montreal. The publication is accessible online at https://glsars.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/180.

Pal's academic journey began in 2014 when she served as a Project Scholar at the Rajiv Gandhi School of IP Laws, IIT Kharagpur. There, she worked on an MHRD project focused on the Policy Planning, Legal Assessment, and Governance of Smart Cities, supervised by Dr. Indrajit Dube. Her role involved cataloging various legislations related to land use planning, building, and heritage, while also examining the institutional interactions and interventions within these frameworks. This experience sparked her interest in the teleological aspects of land and landscapes, leading her to delve into concepts such as heritage, historicity, authenticity, and integrity of buildings and precincts.

In her teaching philosophy, Pal emphasizes inclusive participation and experiential learning. She encourages students to engage in classroom discussions, share speculations, and raise questions. Her pedagogical approach incorporates internships and boot camps to facilitate problem-based learning. She typically teaches classes of around 60 students, who are categorized into different ability levels (A to C). The subjects she covers include Legal Methods, Jurisprudence, Interpretation of Statutes, and the Transfer of Property Act. Her teaching methods vary from traditional whiteboard instruction to PowerPoint presentations and mock debates, allowing for a dynamic learning environment. Assessments are tailored to the cohort's strengths and weaknesses and include quizzes, case comments, and theoretical analyses.

Since joining UPES, Pal has observed a significant evolution in teaching methodologies, moving from individualized course plans to a standardized common course framework. This shift has enhanced collaborative learning and aligned teaching with assessment strategies, ensuring that intended learning outcomes are closely mapped to course content.
