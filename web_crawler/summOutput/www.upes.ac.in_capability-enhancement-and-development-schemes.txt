Students also have the opportunity to connect with alumni for guidance regarding placements.

5. **Remedial Coaching**: For students struggling academically (those scoring below 40% in Mid-Term Exams), remedial classes are offered to address learning gaps and improve performance. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to foster confidence and engagement in learning.

6. **Health and Well-Being Initiatives**: UPES emphasizes the importance of physical and mental health through yoga and meditation classes, which are designed to enhance students' overall well-being, concentration, and memory.

7. **Experiential Learning Events**: The Department of Humanities organizes flagship events in collaboration with Dale Carnegie that focus on behavioral, people, and presentation skills. These events are aimed at facilitating the transition from school to college and from college to industry through experiential learning activities.

8. **EDGE Community Page**: This platform on the UPES Learning Management System serves as a social tool for students to schedule career coaching and counseling sessions, enhancing their adaptability and employability skills.

Overall, these initiatives collectively aim to prepare students to become industry-ready professionals while fostering personal growth and resilience in the face of challenges. The commitment to student engagement and support is evident through various programs designed to address both academic and personal development needs.
