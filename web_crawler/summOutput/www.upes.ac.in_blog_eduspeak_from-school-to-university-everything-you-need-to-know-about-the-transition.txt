The transition from school to university can be daunting, often involving three distinct phases: initial uncertainty, followed by skepticism, and finally adaptation. Many students experience emotions such as frustration and fear of change, particularly in their first year, which can negatively impact their academic performance. However, successful adaptation leads to skill acquisition, confidence, and adjustment to new learning routines.

UPES fosters a holistic development approach, encouraging students to engage in extracurricular activities alongside their academic pursuits. This includes participation in social clubs, workshops, and community engagement initiatives, which help students develop essential life skills such as time management, critical thinking, and leadership.

The university follows a Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS), allowing students the flexibility to choose courses that align with their interests and career goals. This system promotes interdisciplinary learning and provides students with the opportunity to exceed the required credits.

UPES has numerous success stories, showcasing the impact of its supportive ecosystem on student development. For instance, Abheesht Singh, a B.Tech student, created CavenX, a virtual schooling platform, while alumnus Suyash Jain initiated a social project to aid employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another student, Kumar Nidhi, despite early struggles, became the first recipient of the Shikhar Thales Scholarship and gained admission to a prestigious master's program in France.

In conclusion, UPES is committed to nurturing its students, providing them with the tools and opportunities to thrive academically and personally. The university emphasizes the importance of a supportive transition from school to higher education, helping students navigate the challenges they face.
