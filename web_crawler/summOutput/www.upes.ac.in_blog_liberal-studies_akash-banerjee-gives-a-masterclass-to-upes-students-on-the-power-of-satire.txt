The content discusses the evolving landscape of digital media and its implications for education and career opportunities, particularly for students in fields such as journalism and public relations. It emphasizes the necessity for students to be educated on the new social media guidelines introduced by the government, which may impose restrictions on digital media, a platform that is increasingly vital for communication and expression.

The text highlights the importance of mastering social media skills, which can lead to various career paths, especially in public relations, corporate communications, and data analytics. A two-day event, organized by a student team called ‘Fearless Falcons’ on August 28-29, aims to feature discussions with prominent leaders and students, reflecting the growing interest in liberal arts education in India.

The speaker, Akash Banerjee, founder and host of ‘The DeshBhakt’, shares insights from his extensive journalism career, underscoring the role of humor in amplifying the impact of factual reporting. He stresses the challenges faced by journalists in today’s politically charged environment, where speaking truth to authority can invite backlash. Banerjee explains that his platform operates on a model primarily driven by subscriber support and memberships rather than traditional advertising, allowing for greater independence.

The content touches on the significance of satire as a medium for critique and expression, differentiating it from stand-up comedy. It also reflects on the broader societal implications of media, including the historical context of democracy and the separation of religion from state affairs, which Banerjee argues is crucial for modern governance.

Additionally, the UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies) School of Modern Media is mentioned as a hub for training students in new-age media, with various programs aimed at fostering social consciousness and practical skills through initiatives like the Srijan Social Internship program.

The discussion concludes by emphasizing the need for students to develop resilience against criticism, as the media landscape becomes more scrutinized and contentious. The overarching message is one of empowerment, urging students to leverage their education in liberal arts and media to navigate and contribute meaningfully to society.
