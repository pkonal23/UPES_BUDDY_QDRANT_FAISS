The primary goal of User Experience (UX) design is to develop user-friendly and enjoyable experiences for users, while User Interface (UI) design focuses on creating visually appealing and interactive interfaces. The UPES School of Design, mentored by experts from IBM and IKEA, has recently achieved notable recognition for its design projects. One such project won the ‘CII Young Designer Award 2022’, the D’source DIC-BHU Award from IIT Bombay, and received an honourable mention at the Student Service Design Challenge 2022 during Barcelona Design Week.

A UX designer's role includes enhancing the attractiveness of a product by incorporating eye-catching features, while also ensuring that the user experience is seamless and intuitive. This includes analyzing user flows and task completion to identify areas for improvement. In contrast, UI design is digital-centric, emphasizing the effectiveness of visual elements such as icons, buttons, typography, and color schemes.

The UPES School of Design fosters creativity and innovation, offering a Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) program that prepares students for diverse career paths in design. Recent highlights include student Kavya Jayaprakash, who secured a paid internship with Accenture during a semester exchange in France. The curriculum encourages practical experiences, including internships, which are crucial for bridging theoretical knowledge and real-world application.

Students pursuing a B.Des. can expect to engage in various design disciplines, including Graphics and Communication Design, and are encouraged to develop their creative skills through challenging projects. The demand for UX designers is increasing, providing ample job opportunities and potential for career advancement, including roles like UX manager or creative director.

The UPES School of Design emphasizes the importance of sustainability in design, particularly in the context of modern mobility solutions and fashion. The institution supports students in exploring innovative design concepts that address environmental concerns while meeting consumer expectations.
