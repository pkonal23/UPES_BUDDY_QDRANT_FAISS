Rishabh Dua, a student specializing in Transportation Mobility Design at the School of Design, has achieved notable recognition by securing the 2nd prize in the poster presentation category at the Humanizing Work and Work Environment (HWWE) 2022 conference. His innovative design, aimed at aiding individuals with Arthritis and those requiring walking assistance, features several practical elements including a Phone stand, a Bottle holder, and a Flip Seat. This design allows users to sit comfortably whenever needed, thus eliminating the inconvenience of searching for a chair or waiting for assistance.

Rishabh's presentation was aligned with the theme "Ergonomics for the New Normal," showcasing his commitment to creating solutions that enhance usability and comfort for individuals facing mobility challenges. His mentor, Senior Associate Professor Kishor Tikale, has played a significant role in guiding him throughout this project.
