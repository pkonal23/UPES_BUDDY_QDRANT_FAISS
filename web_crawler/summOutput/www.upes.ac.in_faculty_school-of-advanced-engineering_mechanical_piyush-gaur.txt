Dr. Piyush Gaur is currently an Assistant Professor (Senior Scale) at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) and has an extensive academic and research background in aerospace structures and computational mechanics. Prior to joining UPES, he served as an Associate Professor at the School of Aeronautical Science, Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science in Chennai. He has over 9 years of experience in research, focusing on experimental and computational biomechanics, as well as advanced nanocomposite applications within the aerospace and defense sectors.

Dr. Gaur's notable past role includes being a Postdoctoral Fellow at IIT Delhi from 2019 to 2020, where he led a team on a DRDO-funded project that studied the impact and blast response of human body soft tissues. His research portfolio is impressive, featuring over 20 publications, 15 conference presentations, and 10 patents (published or filed).

His teaching methodology emphasizes dynamic and interactive approaches, including active learning and project-based learning. Dr. Gaur aims to develop interdisciplinary courses such as "Ergonomics in Engineering Design" and "Mechanics of Soft Materials," focusing on empowering students to effectively generate, acquire, and apply knowledge.

Dr. Gaur has received several accolades, including an International Merit Scholarship from Coventry University for his MS in Automotive Engineering, and funding from Jaguar Land Rover and TSB for his research on fatigue and fracture in adhesively bonded joints. He is also a recipient of the Volvo Travel Fellowship awarded by TRIPP, IIT Delhi for four consecutive years and is currently a SERB TARE fellow from 2023 to 2026.

In his teaching role, Dr. Gaur covers a range of subjects, including Strength of Materials, Engineering Mechanics, Machine Design, Finite Element Methods, Mechanical Behaviour of Materials, and Mechanics of Composite Materials. He also introduces interdisciplinary topics such as Mechanobiology and Biomedical Instrumentation, alongside defense technology.

His current research interests encompass Experimental and Computational Biomechanics, Nanocomposites for Aerospace and Defense Applications, Human Body Modelling, Material Characterization, and Impact and Blast Mechanism. At UPES, he has initiated a multidisciplinary team focused on developing graphene-based advanced combat helmets and lightweight materials for aerospace applications. His work emphasizes the characterization and modeling of materials under various loading conditions, supported by funding from a DST TARE grant and seed money from UPES, along with project proposals submitted to ARDB and DRDO.

Dr. Gaur has previously worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Coventry University, guest faculty at BITS Pilani, and has held positions at JK Lakshmipat University and Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science.
