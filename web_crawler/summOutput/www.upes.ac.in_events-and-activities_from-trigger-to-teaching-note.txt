The workshop titled "From Trigger to Teaching Note" was designed to enhance the skills of participants in creating compelling case studies. It took place on July 26-27, 2024, at the Auditorium of the School of Business, UPES Kandoli Campus. The event was led by Mahak Garg, a Stanford GSB alum and Forbes Under 30 honoree, who serves as the Director of PGP Materâ€™s Union.

The workshop emphasized interactive learning and combined theoretical insights with hands-on activities. Participants, primarily faculties and scholars from prestigious institutions across India, engaged in role plays that allowed them to experience the perspectives of both case protagonists and writers. This experiential approach aimed to develop their interviewing and storytelling abilities, providing a deeper understanding of the case study development process. Attendees learned to identify and avoid common writing pitfalls, manage data effectively, and adhere to established publication guidelines.

In addition to skill enhancement, the workshop fostered a collaborative learning environment, encouraging participants to share their experiences and insights. Real-world examples illustrated effective case structuring and teaching methods, giving attendees a comprehensive view of what constitutes a successful case study. By the conclusion of the workshop, participants reported increased confidence in their ability to write and publish high-quality case studies that effectively engage and educate their audiences.

Overall, the event not only improved individual skills but also promoted networking and collaboration, creating a community of future case writers and educators. Mr. Shashi Ranjan, Executive Director at ONGC Academy, was noted as a key figure in the event's organization.
