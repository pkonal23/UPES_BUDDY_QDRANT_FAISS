Dr. Ramesh Kumar Saini is an accomplished plant biotechnologist with a focus on food analytical techniques, particularly in LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. He has a strong track record in research, having published 85 articles in 36 internationally recognized journals, accumulating an impressive impact factor of 465.1 and over 6300 citations, which places him among the top 2% of scientists globally according to a report by Stanford University researchers.

Dr. Saini's research interests include:

1. Simplified extraction of nutraceuticals, especially carotenoids.
2. Development and validation of analytical methods for identifying and quantifying nutraceuticals in food.
3. Novel food processing methods to preserve the nutritional value of industrial crops.
4. Valorization of agro-industrial wastes for producing nutritionally important metabolites.
5. Investigating the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of natural carotenoids against various cancer cells.

He has contributed significantly to various projects, including a recently completed externally funded project on the recovery of astaxanthin from shrimp processing waste, which was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea with a grant of 90 million KRW (approximately 55 lakh INR).

Dr. Saini has also been involved in teaching and mentoring students in laboratory settings, fostering critical thinking and hands-on experience in quantitative methods. His dedication to education is reflected in his active participation in an interdisciplinary advanced techniques course in analytical chemistry, aimed at biotechnologists unfamiliar with advanced analytical methods.

In addition to his research and teaching roles, Dr. Saini serves as an Associate Editor for 'Frontiers in Nutrition' and is part of the editorial board for the journal 'Foods,' ensuring the publication of high-quality research in the fields of nutrition and food science.
