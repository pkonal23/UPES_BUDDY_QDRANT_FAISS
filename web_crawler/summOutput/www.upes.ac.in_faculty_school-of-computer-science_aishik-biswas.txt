Professor Aishik Biswas is a dedicated educator and researcher in the field of computer science, particularly focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). His teaching philosophy emphasizes creating a dynamic and interactive learning environment that promotes critical thinking and practical application of knowledge. He advocates for a "flipped classroom" model, where students engage with pre-reading assignments and quizzes prior to class, allowing in-class time to be utilized for hands-on projects and real-world problem-solving. This method not only solidifies theoretical concepts but also equips students with the skills needed to address complex challenges in AI and ML.

Currently, Professor Biswas teaches at the School of Computer Science and covers a variety of programming and technical courses, including C, C++, Java, SQL, Mathematics, Problem Solving, and Database Management Systems. He has a strong emphasis on coding languages, particularly Python, where he demonstrates high proficiency. His goal is to provide students with a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving, preparing them for advanced studies in AI and ML.

Before joining UPES as one of its youngest faculty members, Professor Biswas gained valuable experience as a Data Analyst at Canadian Tire Corp. in Canada and subsequently taught for over a year at an institute in India. He holds a Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science from Lakehead University, a prestigious Canadian institution. His research interests lie at the intersection of AI, ML, and medical science, focusing on applications such as cancer detection and drug abuse, with a specialization in Computer Vision and Deep Neural Networks.

In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Professor Biswas is actively involved in scholarly activities and mentoring students. He encourages participation in coding contests like hackathons, problem-solving on platforms such as LeetCode, and contributing to open-source projects on GitHub. His mentorship aims to empower students to develop their skills, build confidence, and pursue their ambitions in technology and innovation.
