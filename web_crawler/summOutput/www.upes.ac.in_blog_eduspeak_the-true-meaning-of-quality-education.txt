The article discusses the profound impact of linguistic communication on thought and character development, emphasizing that the language we use can either discourage or inspire those around us. It argues that modern education should extend beyond traditional material learning to include moral education, facilitating the holistic development of students. This perspective is gaining traction among academic leaders globally.

The author, Jyoti Bansal, who serves as the Associate Director of Quality Assurance & Accreditation at UPES, advocates for the integration of moral education into teaching methodologies. She believes that educators play a crucial role in the moral empowerment of students by acknowledging their virtuous behaviors—such as respect, trust, and patience—rather than merely focusing on academic performance. Bansal suggests that language can be a tool for promoting personal responsibility and respect, replacing negative behaviors like shaming and blaming.

The article references the ‘Language Virtues Project’, which highlights the power of language in fostering positive interactions without requiring significant changes to teaching practices. Bansal acknowledges the challenges teachers face in balancing curriculum demands with the need for moral development but insists that it is possible to cultivate an environment of love, trust, and respect through the careful choice of words.

Additionally, the article notes that the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in India recognizes the importance of promoting universal values, such as truth and non-violence, in educational settings. Bansal concludes by stressing the importance of moral leadership among students and the potential of language to influence and reflect our values and respect for others.
