The UPES School of Health Science and Technology has achieved a significant milestone by hosting one of the first SPARSH - BIRAC Centres in Uttarakhand. SPARSH, which stands for Social Innovation Programme for Products: Affordable & Relevant to Societal Health, is designed to mentor SPARSH fellows and young social innovators over a five-year period, focusing on the development of prototypes and technologies in three vital thematic areas: Climate Resilience, Farm-to-Plate, and Public Health.

Dr. Nidhi Chauhan serves as the Principal Investigator for this initiative and has led her team at UPES to secure one of India's most prestigious grants from the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC). This funding will be utilized to establish the "SWACHH - Social Wellness, Agriculture, Clean and Hospitable Habitat" Incubation Centre at UPES, further emphasizing the institution's commitment to societal health and innovation.
