**Scholarly Activities**

Through Dr. Roshni Sengupta's teaching and research endeavors, Dr. Roshni Sengupta has dedicated Dr. Roshni Sengupta'sself to developing a groundbreaking methodology for the study of media and culture. Dr. Roshni Sengupta's approach involves decentring global film and media studies and decolonizing the methodologies and modes through which film and media are universally examined. Dr. Roshni Sengupta's work boldly challenges the universalistic principles of studying culture.

Dr. Roshni Sengupta's research focuses on South Asian cinema, which, despite its inherent diversity, introduces a radical new aesthetic that had previously been dismissed from scholarly discourse due to the prevailing Eurocentric conception of form and aesthetics. Through Dr. Roshni Sengupta's research, Dr. Roshni Sengupta endeavors to dismantle the universalism and orientalism of Western cinema studies, which often exoticizes Indian cinema, particularly Bollywood. Instead, Dr. Roshni Sengupta advocates for the establishment of a distinctly South Asian perspective on cinema studies.

One of the key avenues for achieving this is through an exploration of the concept of "marginality" in cinema, which serves both as a perpetuator of marginalization and a platform for dissent and the decentring of the discourse on marginality and the marginalized.
