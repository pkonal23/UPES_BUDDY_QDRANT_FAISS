The provided content outlines the career opportunities and course structures for law and design programs, particularly focusing on the LL.B. (Bachelor of Legislative Law) and B.Des. (Bachelor of Design) degrees offered by UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies). 

### Career Opportunities Offered by the Course
Both the LL.B. and B.Des. programs prepare students for diverse career paths. The LL.B. program, which can be pursued as a 3-year or a 5-year course, covers essential legal subjects such as Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, and Contract Law. The 3-year LL.B. is tailored for students who already hold an undergraduate degree, while the 5-year LL.B. integrates undergraduate education with law studies, allowing students to enter the legal profession directly after high school. Specializing in areas like Intellectual Property, Environmental Law, or Cyber Law can further enhance career prospects.

### Course Structure
1. **LL.B. Programs**:
   - **3-Year LL.B.**: Requires a prior bachelor’s degree, focuses solely on law subjects, and is suitable for those looking to switch careers or further their education in law.
   - **5-Year LL.B.**: Designed for students coming straight from high school, this program combines general education with law courses, offering a broader knowledge base.

2. **B.Des. Program**: 
   - The B.Des. program emphasizes creativity and innovation, preparing students for careers in various design fields, including fashion, product design, and user experience (UX) design. The curriculum includes practical training through internships and projects.

### Admission Requirements
