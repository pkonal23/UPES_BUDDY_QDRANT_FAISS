Their accolades include:

1. **CII Young Designer Award 2022** - A prestigious award recognizing outstanding design talent.
2. **'D' Source DIC-BHU Award** - This award was presented during an event hosted by IIT Bombay, highlighting their innovative design approach.

Renteco operates on a circular economy model, focusing exclusively on renting out previously used items.

This project exemplifies a commitment to sustainability while addressing the practical needs of college students.
