**Summary of Student Achievements and Startup Initiative: Anime Devta**

Diana George highlights the entrepreneurial journey of Dev Taneja and Higmanshu Goswami, students from the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), who co-founded ‘Anime Devta’. This startup aims to provide unique anime and graphic merchandise at affordable prices, catering specifically to the youth demographic.

The anime phenomenon gained traction in India in the early 2000s, notably with the popularity of the Japanese series Pokémon, which played a significant role in making anime mainstream. The success of Pokémon in both television and merchandise has spurred a growing interest in anime culture, leading to an increased demand for related products.

Dev Taneja, who is pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, has been an avid anime fan since childhood. He credits anime series like Naruto and One Piece for imparting valuable life lessons such as perseverance and hard work. With two years of experience as a YouTube creator, where he reviewed anime and promoted merchandise, he identified a gap in the market for affordable anime products in India. 

The duo's brand, Anime Devta, is designed to offer high-quality merchandise at prices that are 50-60% lower than established competitors, making it accessible to students aged 15 to 24 who often rely on limited monthly allowances. The startup leverages social media for marketing, minimizing costs and maximizing outreach to its target audience.

Anime Devta’s products are available through their website, and they actively engage with their audience via Instagram (@anime_devta). The initiative reflects a broader trend of increasing anime popularity in India, driven by iconic shows like Attack on Titan, Naruto, and Dragon Ball Z.
