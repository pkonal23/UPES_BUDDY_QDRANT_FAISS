The Mechatronics program at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) is distinguished by its NBA accreditation, which underscores its alignment with industry standards and its unique contributions over the past decade. This program is closely connected to the Drone Centre of Excellence, signifying its strong potential within the aerospace engineering sector.

The National Education Policy 2020 emphasizes the importance of research and innovation in academia, advocating for financial support for research initiatives. This aligns with the growing demand for aerospace engineering graduates, particularly as the industry embraces sustainable engineering practices to address environmental challenges.

Mechatronics engineering is highlighted as a dynamic field that merges mechanical, computer, and electronic systems. This interdisciplinary approach not only provides fulfilling career opportunities but also positions professionals as vital contributors to technological advancements and automation across various industries. As automation increasingly takes precedence, the relevance of mechanical engineering alone is waning, necessitating a foundational understanding of electronics for engineers. Consequently, mechatronics engineers, who can integrate both mechanical and electronic skills, are highly sought after in the job market.

The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) is transforming the automotive industry, with a reported 42% increase in EV sales in India. This shift is creating new job opportunities, particularly in sustainable and renewable energy engineering, where graduates can pursue roles such as solar energy system engineers and wind farm designers.

UPES emphasizes practical experience through industrial tours, such as the recent visit of Aerospace & Avionics Engineering students to Hyderabad, which provided valuable insights into the industry. The program also boasts a strong track record in research and development, with students and faculty contributing to patents and product innovations.

Career prospects for graduates in mechatronics are promising, with opportunities across manufacturing, robotics, and aerospace industries. The program's graduates often secure competitive salaries due to their specialized skills, and many pursue advanced degrees at prestigious international universities. UPES has established partnerships with leading companies like BOSCH Rexroth, Siemens, KPIT, and FANUC, facilitating technology transfer and research collaboration.

The Mechatronics program has been operational for 13 years, producing over 700 alumni who work with multinational companies worldwide. The program is supported by significant infrastructure investments exceeding â‚¹10 crores, featuring state-of-the-art laboratories and facilities for hands-on learning, including AI and Machine Learning labs, robotics labs, and flexible manufacturing systems.

In summary, UPES's Mechatronics program offers a comprehensive education that prepares students for a rapidly evolving job market, emphasizing sustainability, innovation, and practical experience. For further inquiries or admission details, interested individuals may contact UPES directly.
