Dr. Ravi S Iyer, Dean of the School of Computer Science at UPES, has articulated a strategic vision for the upcoming Center of Excellence focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The center aims to foster fundamental research in AI while emphasizing practical applications, empowering students through hands-on experiences, and promoting collaborations with governmental and industrial sectors to expedite AI adoption. This initiative aligns with the National Education Policy 2020, which highlights the importance of research and innovation in academia.

The university has earmarked â‚¹50 crore for the establishment of this state-of-the-art facility, which will serve as a hub for innovation and specialized training in AI and Data Sciences. The center will support over 50 researchers and is designed to address real-world challenges faced by various industries, including healthcare, law, energy, manufacturing, and public administration. It seeks to cultivate a self-sustaining ecosystem that nurtures AI-driven technologies and solutions.

In addition to AI, the document discusses emerging career paths in engineering fields, particularly in sustainable and renewable engineering, aerospace engineering, and electric vehicle (EV) technology. The rise of electric vehicles in India has seen a notable increase in sales by 42%, indicating a significant shift in the automotive industry. The text also touches on the importance of mechatronics engineering, which integrates mechanical, computer, and electronic systems, and highlights the growing trend of hydrogen-powered vehicles as the next major innovation following EVs.

The UPES School of Engineering is also noted for its commitment to experiential learning, providing students with opportunities to engage in industry projects and visits to leading organizations such as ISRO and Bharat Dynamics Limited. The document emphasizes the importance of choosing the right educational path post-B.Tech, whether pursuing an M.Tech or an MBA, and discusses the diverse career opportunities available to graduates in fields like chemical engineering, geology, and civil engineering.
