The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has established itself as a rapidly growing institution in India, particularly in the realm of research output and academic excellence. The university emphasizes the integration of practical experience into its educational framework by inviting professionals from various industries to share their insights with students, thereby enhancing their understanding of real-world applications of theoretical concepts.

At the UPES School of Law, a significant focus is placed on clinical legal education, which develops essential practical skills such as research, advocacy, counseling, and legal drafting. This approach is designed to equip students with a thorough understanding of market practices and commercial transactions, distinguishing them in the competitive legal landscape. The Bar Council of India and the University Grants Commission (UGC) recognize the value of involving practicing advocates in law education, leading UPES to implement a policy for appointing Professors of Practice (PoPs). This initiative aims to engage senior legal professionals in teaching, aligning UPES with international best practices observed in top law schools worldwide.

In terms of research, UPES has achieved remarkable growth, with a publication output of approximately four papers per faculty member annually. The university's research output has increased by over 370% since 2018, and its Field-Weighted Citation Impact was 1.76 in 2023. By May 2024, this figure was 1.59, with 30% of publications appearing in the top 10% of journals by CiteScore percentiles. Notably, UPES ranks among leading institutions globally, including MIT and Oxford, and has surpassed the research output of several prominent Indian institutions.

UPES boasts a distinguished faculty, including 46 members recognized among the top 2% of researchers globally, according to a Stanford University study. Five of these faculty members are listed as Highly Cited Researchers by Clarivate. The university collaborates with prestigious organizations such as CERN and KEK, contributing to significant projects like the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and Belle II.

The university supports over 660 PhD scholars and allocates â‚¹13 Crore annually for research fellowships. Its academic community features notable scholars, including a Nobel Prize nominee and recipients of esteemed scholarships such as Rhodes, Fulbright, and Erasmus, who have been trained at top global institutions, including Harvard and Cambridge.

As of the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, UPES holds a rank of 46 overall, with specific ranks of 42 in engineering, 41 in management, and 28 in law. The university's commitment to fostering a culture of research and innovation is evident through initiatives like internal SEED funding for research ideas and the development of advanced research facilities.
