Dr. Dhiraj Kumar is an Assistant Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering, UPES, specializing in Mechanical Engineering. His teaching philosophy focuses on guiding and motivating students to deeply understand core concepts while enhancing their problem-solving skills to tackle complex engineering challenges. He integrates real-world engineering applications into assignments and tutorials to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical experience.

Prior to his position at UPES, Dr. Kumar served as a Senior Project Engineer at IIT Kanpur, where he accumulated over two years of experience as a Research Fellow. His work involved several industrial and sponsored research projects that dealt with aerodynamic testing of small-scale air vehicle models and various engineering structures like high-rise buildings, cooling towers, and bridges, all under dynamic wind loads and vibrations. He possesses extensive expertise in various measurement techniques, including Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), hotwire and pressure measurements, strain and force measurements, infrared thermography, flow visualization, and high-speed imaging. Additionally, Dr. Kumar is skilled in LabVIEW programming and data acquisition systems.

Dr. Kumar has a robust academic background, having earned both his master's and PhD degrees in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Kanpur. His doctoral research was supported by a Graduate Research Fellowship, and he distinguished himself by ranking in the top 1% among 81,175 candidates in the GATE (ME) exam in 2011. His primary research interests revolve around Experimental Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics, with a particular focus on flow-induced vibrations and fluid-structure interactions. He is currently exploring renewable energy harvesting, specifically from wind and water currents, as well as flow control over wings. Dr. Kumar has contributed to reputable international journals with publications on flow-induced oscillations.

At UPES, he teaches a variety of courses, including Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Machines, Mechanics of Materials, Workshop Practices Lab, Fluid Mechanics Lab, Advanced Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics, and Fluid Flow for Food Technology.
