The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) offers both online and on-campus B.Tech programs, catering to diverse student needs. While online programs lack the physical campus experience, UPES promotes engagement through virtual clubs, webinars, and skill-building workshops, aiming to simulate aspects of campus life. On-campus students enjoy direct access to libraries, labs, and professors, enhancing their educational experience and facilitating in-person guidance from faculty and academic advisors.

The National Education Policy 2020 emphasizes the importance of research and innovation in academia, advocating for financial support for academic research. The choice between online and on-campus B.Tech programs hinges on personal learning styles and career aspirations. On-campus programs provide a structured environment with live lectures and group projects, which benefit students who thrive on routine and direct interaction. In contrast, online programs offer flexibility, allowing students to manage their studies around personal commitments, with resources available 24/7.

UPES also integrates industry interactions for online students through webinars, virtual internships, and remote projects, ensuring practical insights despite the lack of physical presence. Both formats emphasize assessments to evaluate knowledge and skills, with online programs often using open-book formats, while on-campus assessments include written exams and practical tests.

Financial considerations are significant, as online programs tend to be more affordable due to the absence of accommodation and commuting costs. Additionally, on-campus experiences offer extracurricular activities, guest lectures, and networking opportunities that contribute to personal development and career readiness.

UPES encourages students to consider their preferences regarding flexibility, resource access, and social engagement when choosing between online and on-campus B.Tech programs. The university provides robust digital support for online learners, ensuring they have the necessary tools for success.
