Siddhi Deshpande, Bhasha Maheshwari, and Shruti Maheshwari, students specializing in Industrial Product Design within the B.Des. program, received a Special Mention Award in Product Design at the MIT-WPU National Design Award 2022. This recognition was awarded for their innovative product, Vendo, which addresses menstrual hygiene management in public restrooms.

Vendo is a pioneering solution that combines the functionalities of a sanitary napkin vending machine and an incinerator. This design not only ensures the easy disposal of used sanitary napkins through its incinerator feature but also provides continuous access to sanitary napkins via its vending function. The machine is user-friendly, operating with a minimal token fee of INR 5, and offers users three different pad size options.

This achievement highlights the creativity and commitment of the trio in developing a sustainable, accessible, and eco-friendly product aimed at improving hygiene management for women in public spaces.
