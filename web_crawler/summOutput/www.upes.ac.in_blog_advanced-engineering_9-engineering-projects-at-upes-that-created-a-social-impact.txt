The UPES School of Engineering recently highlighted nine innovative projects aimed at benefiting five adopted villages: Bidholi, Bishanpur, Upper Kandoli, Pondha, and Donga. These projects included:

1. **Flying Cars**: Demonstrated the potential use of drones (UAVs) for transporting essential goods like medicine and food, and aiding agricultural activities, with a vision for future flying cars.
   
2. **Electric Cycle**: Focused on converting regular bicycles into electric ones, particularly beneficial in hilly regions, featuring a rechargeable battery that lasts 20-25 km.

3. **Waste Management**: Educated on reducing waste production through recycling biodegradable materials into compost and proper waste disposal methods.

4. **Water Security**: Introduced a novel water filtration system using dried orange and sugarcane peels to purify drinking water, with plans to install these filters in every village household.

5. **First Aid**: Included presentations on first aid equipment and demonstrations of CPR and safety measures, with future plans to provide 24/7 medical assistance.

6. **Fire and Safety**: Conducted mock drills to educate about safety protocols during fire emergencies.

7. **Women Empowerment through Medicinal and Aromatic Plants**: Encouraged women in the villages to cultivate local medicinal plants like chamomile and tulsi for producing cosmetics and medicines, thereby promoting financial independence.

8. **Solar Driers**: Designed to efficiently dry food items like cereals and vegetables using solar power, saving time and space.

9. **Biochar Bio Briquette**: Developed as an alternative energy source made from half-burnt wood and cow dung, producing less smoke and aiming to reduce health-related issues caused by traditional fuels.

The Vice-Chancellor of the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Dr. C. P. Ramanarayanan, spoke on the engineering capabilities of Rafale jets, emphasizing the changing nature of warfare. The Dean of the School of Engineering, Professor Gurvinder Singh Virk, expressed gratitude to the local Panchayat for their collaboration and support.

The National Education Policy 2020 stresses the importance of research and innovation in academia, and the UPES editorial team is actively involved in promoting these initiatives.
