Dr. K.S.R. Murthy is an Associate Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering at UPES, with extensive research interests and teaching experience in the fields of chemistry and nanomaterials. His research focuses on several key areas, including:

1. **pH-responsive Luminescence Sensing**: Investigating materials that change their luminescent properties based on pH levels.
2. **Photoredox Catalysis**: Exploring the use of light to drive redox reactions in chemical processes.
3. **Photodynamic Applications of Ruthenium (II) Photosensitizers**: Utilizing ruthenium compounds in photodynamic therapy and other applications.
4. **Development of Instant Linear Gels**: Designing gels for coal bed methane gas operations and eco-friendly gels for oil well recovery through hydro-fracturing.
5. **Nanoparticle Doping**: Studying the effects of aluminum and aluminum-copper dual doping on the properties of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles.
6. **Heavy Metal Removal**: Conducting research on the removal of copper and cadmium from industrial effluents using mixed adsorbents, including the use of orange peel as an adsorbent for modeling copper (II) and iron (II) removal.

Dr. Murthy has taught major chemistry courses for BTech students, as well as Principles of Analytical Chemistry and Instrumental Methods of Analysis for BSc and MSc chemistry majors. He actively guides students in their dissertation projects and encourages participation in national and international conferences.

His academic credentials include receiving the Association of Commonwealth Universities scholarship for his MS in the UK, along with several research grants under various schemes such as RISE and SODH at UPES. He has also been awarded R&D accolades from UPES from 2014 to 2017 for his significant contributions to research.

Prior to his tenure at UPES, Dr. Murthy accumulated nearly a decade of teaching experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in various universities, including a role as an assistant professor at Hawassa University in Ethiopia, where he taught analytical chemistry and contributed to curriculum development.

Dr. Murthy's teaching philosophy emphasizes a student-centered approach, fostering an interactive and inclusive classroom environment that encourages critical thinking and active participation. He integrates real-world examples to connect theoretical knowledge with practical applications.
