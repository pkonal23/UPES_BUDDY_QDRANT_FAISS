Akshara Nair, a B.Des. student specializing in Interior & Retail Space Design from the 2018-22 batch, has conceptualized an innovative folding bed specifically designed for capsule hotels, inspired by their Japanese origins. This project addresses common limitations faced by traditional capsule hotels, such as insufficient guest comfort, limited space for standing, changing clothes, and luggage storage.

The design introduces compact capsules resembling single-sized beds, with sufficient height to allow guests to sit comfortably. To improve functionality, the folding bed replaces the traditional fixed bed, providing guests with the necessary space to stand and change attire. This design not only enhances comfort but also allows for efficient storage of belongings beneath the bed.

The innovative folding mechanism enables easy unfolding for rest and quick folding for standing, catering to the diverse needs of guests and significantly improving their overall experience within the capsule hotel environment. This project reflects a thoughtful approach to enhancing the functionality and comfort of capsule accommodations.
