Dr. Amit Kumar, an Assistant Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering, is mentoring a student project focused on the co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and biomass to produce hydrocarbon fuels. This initiative aligns with the Swachh Bharat Adhyayan campaign, addressing the increasing disposal of plastics due to modern lifestyles. 

The project highlights the potential of solid biomass, which is a widely available energy resource, to be transformed alongside waste plastics through co-pyrolysis. This process aims to enhance the production of fuels and value-added products in a synergistic manner. The end products from this project can serve as chemicals and pollutant sorbents, promoting eco-friendly waste management and sustainability practices.

The project has been undertaken by Naval Kishore Sharma, a third-year student pursuing an Integrated B.Sc. - M.Sc. in Chemistry. He has successfully completed the project on the co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and biomass for hydrocarbon fuels.
