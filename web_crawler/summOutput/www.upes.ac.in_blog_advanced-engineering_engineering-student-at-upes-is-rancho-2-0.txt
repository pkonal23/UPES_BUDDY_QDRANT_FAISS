Krishna Singh, a first-year Electronics and Computer Engineering student at UPES, is noted for his creativity and innovative spirit. He received practical training from a young age at Vivek Vidyalaya in Jamshedpur and has participated in competitions at prestigious institutions like IIT-Bombay and NIT-Jamshedpur. Despite financial challenges faced by his family—his father runs a construction supplies shop and his mother is a homemaker—his parents have always supported his ambitions.

Krishna has made significant contributions at UPES, likening him to the character Ranchoddas from the film "3 Idiots." He repaired a long-defunct machine for his professor and has developed a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) plotter, impressing Uttarakhand's Governor with its capabilities. Additionally, he has created an apparatus for converting plastic into diesel through pyrolysis, earning accolades from former state education minister Dhan Singh Rawat.

His entrepreneurial journey includes launching a startup named Pie Craft, which specializes in creating projects like 3D printers and CNC plotters for fellow students. Krishna's dedication to problem-solving and innovation has led him to build an agri-drone during the COVID-19 lockdown, showcasing his ability to integrate technology with practical applications.

The content also emphasizes the importance of internships for B.Des students, detailing the experiences of other students like Kavya Jayaprakash, who secured a paid internship with Accenture during her semester exchange in France. The narrative encapsulates the vibrant and diverse world of design education at UPES, where creativity, sustainability, and technological advancement converge.
