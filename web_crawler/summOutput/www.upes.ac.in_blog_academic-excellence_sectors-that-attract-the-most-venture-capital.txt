Entrepreneurs often face significant challenges in securing funding for their businesses, particularly in attracting investors and venture capitalists who are willing to overlook inherent risks. Despite these challenges, there are sectors that have garnered notable interest from investors, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, edtech, online gaming, and social media applications are among the sectors that have seen substantial venture capital investments.

Women scientists have emerged as key players in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating resilience and commitment to rebuilding society. This effort is paralleled by the educational sector, where students from various UPES schools—Engineering, Computer Science, Business, Design, and Law—received over 2,500 job offers from more than 480 companies, showcasing a robust placement scenario despite the pandemic.

Bikram Pratim Bhuyan, an Assistant Professor at UPES School of Computer Science, has been awarded the Cotutelle Doctoral Grant to pursue his PhD at the University of Paris-Saclay, France, emphasizing the importance of rigorous preparation for doctoral studies. Additionally, the gaming industry has seen significant investments, with Winzo Games raising $18 million in Series B funding shortly after the ban on PUBG. Other notable funding rounds include AFK Gaming's $200,000 pre-Series A round and MPL and Dream11 raising $90 million and $225 million, respectively.

In the realm of technology, companies like Observe.ai have secured $54 million in Series B financing, while Yellow Messenger and Vernacular AI have also attracted significant funding. The surge in demand for domestic gaming applications, spurred by government restrictions on foreign apps, has led to rapid growth for platforms such as Chingari, Mitron, and Roposo, supported by initiatives like the “Vocal for Local” campaign.

The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology in education, with edtech firms like Byju’s and Unacademy receiving substantial investments. Unacademy recently joined the unicorn club after raising $150 million from Softbank. The focus on indigenous apps has also resulted in funding for platforms like ShareChat, which raised $40 million.

UPES is actively working to bridge the gap between academia and industry by appointing experienced legal practitioners as Professors of Practice within its School of Law, enhancing students' practical skills. Additionally, UPES offers specialized programs in entrepreneurship, such as MBA in Start-Up & Entrepreneurship, which are designed to equip students with the necessary skills to succeed in the competitive start-up landscape.

The rise of AI and machine learning technologies has attracted significant investor interest, particularly in B2B sectors, as businesses adapt to new operational strategies during the pandemic. This context has created a lucrative environment for tech firms that provide innovative solutions.

Overall, the entrepreneurial landscape is evolving, with increased funding opportunities in promising sectors, driven by both market demands and changing consumer behaviors during the pandemic.
