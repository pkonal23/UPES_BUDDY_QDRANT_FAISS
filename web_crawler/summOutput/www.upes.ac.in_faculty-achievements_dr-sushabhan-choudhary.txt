The faculty achievements in Microwave Communication Engineering highlight a significant project aimed at enhancing infrastructure in two critical areas: telecommunications and battery management systems. 

1. **Microwave Telecommunications Facility**: The primary objective is to establish a high-speed line-of-sight microwave telecommunications link between the UPES Bidholi and Kandoli campuses. This facility will facilitate comprehensive research into various aspects of communications, networking, and the impact of weather conditions in mountainous terrains, aligning with flagship projects. The overarching goal is to promote advancements in strategic engineering applications through detailed investigations of diverse scenarios.

2. **Battery Design and Management**: Another key component of the project is the establishment of a facility dedicated to the design, manufacturing, and testing of battery packs utilizing different technologies. This facility aims to ensure the operational efficiency and maintenance of battery health for various systems anticipated in flagship projects. 

3. **Funding and Recognition**: Dr. Sushabhan Choudhary from the School of Advanced Engineering is leading the Research and Development proposal for Communication and Battery Infrastructure. His efforts have secured a DST FIST Project Grant amounting to INR 11,400,000 (One crore and fourteen lakhs) under a 50:50 funding mode.
