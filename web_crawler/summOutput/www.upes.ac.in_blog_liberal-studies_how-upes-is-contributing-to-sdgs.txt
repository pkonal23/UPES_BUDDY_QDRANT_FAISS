The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) is actively engaged in various social impact initiatives aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly focusing on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. The university's efforts include providing financial assistance to the families of martyrs from Uttarakhand, offering complete funding for one martyr's child’s school education annually, and facilitating job opportunities for dependents. Additionally, UPES supports the training and development of martyrs' widows through its Shakti initiative, which empowers women, and grants full higher education scholarships to the children of five martyrs each year.

UPES also aims to empower rural women from indigenous communities by teaching them to produce high-quality goods from waste paper, such as stationery and jewelry, thereby promoting sustainable livelihoods. The university emphasizes partnerships (SDG 17) to achieve these goals, recognizing the increasing demand for professionals skilled in public relations, corporate communications, and data analytics.

The university provides various scholarships for students in financial need, including 33% tuition concessions for Uttarakhand residents, merit-based scholarships, sports scholarships, and freeships for underprivileged students. A notable initiative, Project Abhilasha, identifies meritorious students from marginalized regions and offers them a month-long residential coaching camp to prepare for engineering entrance exams.

UPES conducts healthcare camps, awareness drives in local schools, and various health initiatives to promote good health and well-being (SDG 3). The university has also implemented the UPES Skill Development Program to enhance the skills of support staff.

Moreover, UPES is involved in several projects such as Project Utthan, which aims to transform rural villages into smart communities with a focus on healthcare, education, and livelihood. The university’s initiatives extend to supporting local artisans through Project Artisan, which enhances the skills of women weavers in Ladakh.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, UPES provided dry ration family packs to 1,000 migrant worker families, aiding over 4,000 individuals. The university has also contributed to clean energy projects in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program.

UPES is committed to sustainability, with initiatives like the Waste Paper Recycling Laboratory, Project UK for sustainable development, and the installation of solar power plants on campus. The university’s curriculum promotes interdisciplinary learning, allowing students to design their degrees and engage in social internships through the Srijan program.

In recognition of its contributions, UPES has received visits from prominent figures, including the Governor of Uttarakhand, who praised the university's commitment to sustainable development. The university is dedicated to addressing various SDGs, including quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).
