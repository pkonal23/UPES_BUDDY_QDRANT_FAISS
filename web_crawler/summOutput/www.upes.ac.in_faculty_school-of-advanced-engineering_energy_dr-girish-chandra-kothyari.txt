Dr. Girish Chandra Kothyari is a distinguished scientist in the field of geosciences, particularly recognized for his expertise in active tectonics and tectonic geomorphology. With nearly 18 years of research experience, his work primarily focuses on disaster studies related to earthquakes, landslides, and flash floods, as well as active tectonics, paleoseismology, and satellite geodesy (InSAR). Currently, he is concentrating on two active tectonic regions in India: the Himalayas and the Kachchh Peninsula.

His significant contributions to the field have earned him numerous accolades, including the National Geoscience Award (NGA) in 2017 from the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, and the ISES Award for Senior Scientist in Seismotectonic and Applied Seismology in 2022. Dr. Kothyari has also been recognized in the Stanford University world ranking of the top 2% scientists for both 2021 and 2022. Other notable awards include the Best Poster Presentation Award at the Advances in Earthquake Sciences (AES) in 2014, the Best Presentation Honor at the Indo-US Conference on Intraplate Seismicity in 2012, and the Fast-Track Young Scientist Award from the Department of Science and Technology in 2011.

In addition to his research, Dr. Kothyari has played a vital role in education, teaching a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate courses such as "Rocks and Minerals," "River Science," "Structural Geology," and courses on the applications of MATLAB, GIS, and remote sensing in geosciences. He emphasizes a practical teaching approach that encourages innovative thinking and fosters a creative learning environment. His goal is to instill confidence in his students by strengthening their understanding of fundamental concepts, enabling them to effectively observe, collect, and analyze geological data using modern software tools.

Dr. Kothyari has also been actively involved in scholarly activities, serving as a guest editor for various special issues in prominent journals such as Geodesy and Geodynamics and Quaternary Science Advances. He is a senior associate professor at the School of Advanced Engineering at UPES, where he is focused on enhancing research activities within the geoscience division of the energy cluster.

Before his tenure at UPES, he held various positions at the Institute of Seismological Research in Gandhinagar, including Geophysicist and Project Scientist. He has also worked as a Research Associate at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology and served as a visiting professor at KSKV Kachchh University. Additionally, he is recognized as an external PhD guide for Gujarat University and AKNU, Andhra University.
