Ravi Kiran Maddali is an accomplished Applied Mathematician with over 20 years of teaching experience in postgraduate and undergraduate mathematics courses across science and engineering disciplines. His primary research focus lies in the application of dynamical systems to real-world problems, particularly concerning the interactions among populations in their natural habitats. He is also proficient in technical computing, especially utilizing MATLAB software.

Before his tenure at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), he worked as a Mathematics lecturer at Govt. College (Autonomous) in Rajahmundry and JNTU Hyderabad. During this time, he contributed significantly as a resource person for the 'Numerical Methods and Optimization Techniques' course as part of the 'Advanced Course in Bioinformatics' program, which was a collaboration between JNTU, CDAC, and IICT, Hyderabad. Additionally, he has taught Mathematics courses to industry professionals from Mahindra & Mahindra and Hero MotoCorp as part of their academic enhancement programs at UPES.

Prof. Maddali has undertaken various administrative responsibilities, including course coordination, student counseling, curriculum design, event coordination, admission processes, internship and placement coordination, lab administration, workload management, accreditation, ranking, and cross-cluster auditing. His commitment to research is evident as he actively engages in scholarly work, focusing on mathematical modeling and publishing findings in peer-reviewed journals. He continuously enhances his technical skills through participation in Faculty Development Programs (FDPs), workshops, and conferences.

He has designed a course titled "MATLAB Programming for Engineers," which has benefitted around 600 students, enabling them to apply MATLAB in their projects, dissertations, and research endeavors. He is a member of several professional organizations, including the Systems Society of India, ISIAM, and IAENG Societies of Scientific Computing, Operations Research, and Artificial Intelligence.

In terms of teaching philosophy, Prof. Maddali emphasizes a collaborative and student-centered approach to enhance students' reasoning and understanding. His lectures are structured to improve students' skill sets, focusing on the appropriate use of mathematical terminology to express real-world situations mathematically. He employs a systematic mathematical modeling approach in problem-solving, which includes formulation, conjecture, solution, and practical interpretation of results. He also assigns application-based tasks that encourage students to develop computer programs using MATLAB for complex calculations and visualizations.

Prof. Maddaliâ€™s research interests include Mathematical Modeling & Simulation, Mathematical Biology, Numerical Computing, and Data Science. He teaches a wide array of courses, such as Engineering Mathematics, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Complex Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra, Integral Transforms, Operations Research, Optimization Techniques, Business Mathematics, Statistical Techniques, Remedial Mathematics, Programming in MATLAB, and Theory of Computation.
