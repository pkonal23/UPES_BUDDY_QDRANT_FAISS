Ninian Peckitt is a retired maxillofacial surgeon renowned for his pioneering work in additive manufacturing technology, which has significantly transformed surgical practices. He successfully reduced major surgical operations, previously lasting over 12 hours, to less than 2 hours, allowing these procedures to be performed as day cases. His contributions have not only changed clinical practices but have also enhanced patient outcomes, leading to the widespread acceptance of these methods in mainstream healthcare.

Peckitt introduced several innovative technologies and methodologies in facial reconstructive surgery, including Computer Planning, Photomorphanalysis, CAD CAM technology, and reverse engineering of customized implants, starting in 1999. He has established himself as an international authority on Engineering Assisted Surgery, frequently invited to lecture as a keynote speaker across Europe, the United States, Asia, and Australasia.

In collaboration with skilled engineers, he developed Colour Stereolithography for 3-D tumor mapping, which facilitated the creation of customized cutting and positioning jigs. This innovation allowed for unprecedented accuracy in translating a 3-D surgical plan into a 3-D representation of the patient, significantly improving surgical precision.

Peckitt's work has garnered attention in the press and media, featuring in various television documentaries and achieving global recognition within the medical community. His contributions to the field of maxillofacial surgery and engineering-assisted techniques continue to influence current practices and inspire future advancements in surgical technology.
