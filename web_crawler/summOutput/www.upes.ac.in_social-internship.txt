**Srijan Social Internships**

University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has introduced Srijan Social Internships as part of its School for Life program. Under this initiative, all first-year students are required to complete 6-8 week work internships with social sector organizations.

**Srijan Social Internships**

Srijan Social Internships are full-time engagements with social sector organizations. These internships seek to create awareness about social issues in India. Through these experiences, students confront social development challenges faced by the country. This exposure fosters empathy and develops valuable leadership skills. Post-internship, students may pursue work in social issues on campus, become social entrepreneurs or social sector professionals, or join social sector wings of corporations or government.

These internships provide students with context, enhancing classroom engagement and discussions.

**The Srijan Model**

The Srijan Model comprises three interconnected components:

**Pre-Internship Preparation:**

During pre-internship preparation, students complete a 10-hour course on social issues, covering topics like health, education, and poverty alleviation. This course provides students with a foundational understanding of India's development challenges. Pre-internship preparation also includes springboard sessions, which orient students to the work environment of social sector organizations and provide guidance on best practices for internships. Regular town halls and podcasts address any student inquiries or doubts.

**Actual Internships:**

During internships, students work on assignments assigned by non-profit organizations and engage in UPES-guided activities to deepen their understanding.

**Post-Internship:**

Upon completion of the internship, students return to campus and share their experiences with peers, seniors, faculty, and staff through various means.
