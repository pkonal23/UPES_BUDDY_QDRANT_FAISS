The UPES Global Pathway Program (GPP) offers students an opportunity to complete part of their studies at UPES and the remainder at partner universities located in the UK, Germany, Australia, Canada, or the USA. Selected students are responsible for their travel and accommodation expenses, which vary based on their lifestyle. Students are encouraged to visit individual university websites for specific details regarding these costs.

### Key Programs and Requirements:
- **Programs Offered**: The GPP includes various undergraduate and postgraduate programs such as BA Financial Economics & Accounting, BBA in Events, Public Relations, MS Information Systems, and more.
- **Eligibility Criteria**: 
  - For undergraduate programs, students typically need to have completed 10+2 with a minimum of 50% aggregate.
  - For postgraduate programs, a relevant bachelor’s degree with a minimum CGPA (varies by program) is usually required.
  - English proficiency is required, with IELTS scores generally needing to be 6.0 to 6.5, depending on the partner university's standards.

### Admission Process:
- Students must complete the UPES Entrance Exam, followed by a portfolio presentation and interview, particularly for design courses.
- A Statement of Purpose (SOP) is required, detailing the student's academic and professional background, goals, and reasons for applying.

### Accommodation and Living:
- Students may choose campus accommodation at partner universities, subject to availability, or receive assistance in finding accommodation.
- UPES provides support for visa applications, but students must ensure they have adequate funds to cover living expenses and tuition for their entire program.

### Work Opportunities:
- International students can work part-time during semesters (up to 20 hours per week) and full-time during vacations. Upon completion of their degree, students can apply for a post-study work visa, typically valid for two years, depending on the country.

### Financial Considerations:
- Tuition fees at partner universities do not include accommodation and living expenses, which are the student’s responsibility. Students can expect to save between 12% to 25% on tuition fees through UPES partnerships.
- It is advisable for students to check the individual costs of living at each partner university’s website for a comprehensive understanding of expenses.

### Contact Information:
For more details on specific programs and requirements, students should consult the relevant partner university websites or contact the UPES Department of International Affairs (DIA) for assistance in the application process and other inquiries. 

### Partner Universities Include:
- Virginia Commonwealth University (USA)
- Nottingham Trent University (UK)
- University of Queensland (Australia)
- University of Essex (UK)
- University Canada West (Canada)
- GISMA University of Applied Sciences (Germany)

This structured approach allows students to gain international experience while completing their degrees, enhancing their global job opportunities.
