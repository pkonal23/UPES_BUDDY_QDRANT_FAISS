Dr. Srinivasa Reddy Devarapu is a prominent figure in the field of petroleum engineering, with significant contributions to academia and industry. He has held various roles, including Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at KL University and UPES Dehradun. His academic journey began with an apprenticeship at HPCL, leading to a Ph.D. from IIT Madras in 2015, focusing on in-situ combustion-based enhanced oil recovery.

Dr. Devarapu has been instrumental in shaping petroleum engineering curricula at JNTU Kakinada and KL University, serving as a committee member and chairman for various Board of Studies (BOS) committees. He has played a key role in establishing and improving petroleum engineering laboratories, showcasing his commitment to academic excellence. His research interests encompass mathematical modeling of reservoir flow, eco-friendly drilling fluids, adsorbents for water treatment, and enhanced oil recovery techniques. His work has been published in numerous international journals and he holds several patents, including a notable one for a water-based drilling fluid additive.

Throughout his career, Dr. Devarapu has received several accolades, including the 3rd Prize at the 6th World PetroCoal Congress-2016 for a poster presentation on a mathematical model for well planning in coal bed methane (CBM) wells, and the 2nd Prize in Technical-Quiz Competitions at the SCHEMCON-06.

His teaching philosophy emphasizes continuous learning, integrating concepts like "flipping the classroom" to enhance student engagement. He assigns pre-reading tasks to students to prepare them for class discussions, followed by quizzes and tasks that relate to real-time solutions for flow through petroleum reservoirs.

Dr. Devarapu has also contributed to the academic community as a member of the Board of Studies for the Department of Petroleum Engineering at JNTU Kakinada from April 2019 to March 2022. His scholarly activities include various research publications, such as studies on multiphase flow of crude oil and CO2 sequestration in aquifers.
