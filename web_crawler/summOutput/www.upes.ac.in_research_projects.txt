The content discusses various innovative research projects aimed at addressing critical issues in materials science, agriculture, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. The key projects outlined include:

1. **Hybrid Plasmonic Metasurfaces**: This project seeks to enhance the properties of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers for ballistic protection. By utilizing surface-modified graphene oxide and a patented electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique, the project aims to improve the thermal and mechanical properties of UHMWPE fibers and polyurethane resin. These advancements will be integrated into hybrid laminated composite panels, which will undergo testing for energy absorption during high-velocity impacts, with a focus on damage mechanisms. A 3D finite element model will assist in designing curved composite panels for personal and vehicle armor, ultimately aiming to create lightweight ballistic armor with enhanced survivability.

2. **Dual-Beam Pump-Probe Raman Methodology**: This project aims to develop cost-effective hybrid plasmonic metasurfaces using soft and interference lithography techniques, which will provide high sensitivity for precision applications. It focuses on creating a novel dual-beam pump-probe near-field Raman methodology to enable ultra-sensitive Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) detection, particularly in food and health safety applications. The project also aims to explore the physical mechanisms behind SERS enhancement through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation.

3. **Water Quality in Nainital Lake Region**: The project aims to establish a connection between water quality and diseases in the Nainital Lake area. It involves developing a green nanoparticle-based water filtration system to improve water quality for local communities reliant on spring water. The project will create a water quality map and site-specific action plans to aid future research and sustainable water management.

4. **Nano-Pyrite Priming for Agriculture**: This initiative aims to enhance potato and green fodder crop production in the Himalayan region by developing a sustainable, fertilizer-free nano pyrite seed treatment strategy. The project addresses challenges such as low productivity and fodder deficits, promoting food security and better livelihoods for small-scale farmers.

5. **Biogas Technology Upgrade**: The project focuses on upgrading KVIC-type biogas digesters to enhance efficiency, particularly in colder regions. By incorporating solar heating techniques, the project aims to improve anaerobic digestion processes, thereby supporting sustainable waste management and rural development.

6. **Advanced Composite Panels for Ballistic Protection**: This project develops lightweight, energy-absorbing laminated panels capable of withstanding high-velocity impacts, suitable for military, law enforcement, and civilian security applications. It aims to enhance safety and security measures, with significant societal impacts.

7. **Research on Parkinson's Disease**: This project seeks to identify novel disease-causing genes or variants in families with Juvenile Parkinson's Disease (JPD) in India. It utilizes whole genome sequencing and human-induced pluripotent stem cell studies to explore disease biology and pathways, aiming to advance early diagnostics and personalized therapeutic strategies.

8. **Geohazard Assessment**: The project involves mapping tectonically induced landforms and analyzing geohazard potential in the central Himalayan region. It employs advanced modeling techniques to generate hazard maps that support sustainable urban planning and development.

Overall, these projects are supported by funding agencies such as the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), the Department of Science & Technology (DST), and the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), reflecting a commitment to addressing pressing global challenges through innovative research and technology.
