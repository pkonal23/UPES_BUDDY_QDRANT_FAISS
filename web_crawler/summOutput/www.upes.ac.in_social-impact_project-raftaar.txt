Project Raftaar is an initiative focused on the personality development of students in eight government primary schools through engagement in sports and cultural activities. Recognizing the importance of extra-curricular activities alongside academics, the project aims to cultivate essential qualities such as discipline, concentration, and time management among participating children. 

One of the key components of Project Raftaar is an annual inter-school competition that attracts over 300 participants, providing a valuable platform for students to showcase their talents and compete with their peers. This initiative emphasizes the holistic development of students, ensuring they grow not just academically but also in character and personal skills.
