The collaboration between UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies) and NSE Academy Limited (NAL) aims to enhance finance education by introducing the NSE SMART Fin Lab. This innovative platform will simulate a live trading environment for equity, derivative, and currency derivatives markets, allowing students to practice trading without financial risk. The initiative is designed to provide both short-term and long-term programs tailored for students who wish to deepen their understanding and skills in the finance and technology sectors.

Students enrolled in the UPES MBA and BBA programs will benefit from this partnership by gaining insights into various investing and trading strategies through the NSE SMART Fin Lab. The curriculum will cover a wide array of topics, including financial technology, blockchain management, data science, analytics for finance, machine learning, Python for finance, business analytics, finance for non-finance professionals, statistics for finance, financial valuation, and modeling, among others relevant to the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector and associated technologies.

All programs will be conducted in offline mode, ensuring direct engagement and practical learning experiences for students. This initiative reflects a commitment to bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industry practices in finance and technology. 

For further details regarding eligibility criteria and program specifics, interested students should reach out to the respective departments at UPES or consult the NSE Academy.
