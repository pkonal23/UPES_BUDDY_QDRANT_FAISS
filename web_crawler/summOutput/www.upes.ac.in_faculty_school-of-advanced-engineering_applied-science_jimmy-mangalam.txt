Dr. Jimmy Mangalam is an Assistant Professor at the School of Advanced Engineering, specializing in a diverse array of research areas including Nanotechnology, Material Science, Semiconductor Devices, Metal Oxide Semiconductors, Renewable Energy, Nanoelectronics, Solar Cells, Sensors, Water Purification, Material Characterization, Metal Oxide Frameworks, and the study of Emerging Pollutants. His current research primarily focuses on developing nanomaterials and metal oxide frameworks aimed at targeting pharmaceutical drugs in wastewater treatment.

Dr. Mangalam's teaching philosophy emphasizes the importance of adapting to students' individual learning styles, encouraging them to engage with the subject matter actively. He connects theoretical concepts to practical, real-world applications and fosters an interactive classroom environment through regular discussions and activities. His teaching repertoire includes laboratory courses in Inorganic Chemistry, where he covers techniques such as Titration Methods, Complex Synthesis, UV-Visible Spectroscopy, and X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy. In theory courses, he teaches the Physics of Materials, discussing properties like conductivity, magnetism, phase transitions, as well as industrial chemicals and environmental issues, including Chemical Manufacturing and Renewable Energy types.

Before his tenure at UPES, Dr. Mangalam earned his Ph.D. in Chemistry from ICTM, Technische Universit√§t Graz, Austria, where he researched efficient perovskite solar cells for renewable energy applications. He also worked on the simulation and modeling of Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) during his master's thesis. His practical experience includes an internship at the solid-state physics laboratory at IIST, Thiruvananthapuram, where he developed a polymer-based random access memory device for flexible electronics.
