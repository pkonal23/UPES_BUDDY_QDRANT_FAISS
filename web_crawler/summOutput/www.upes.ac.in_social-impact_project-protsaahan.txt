**Social Impact Summary of Project Protsaahan**

Project Protsaahan, initiated by UPES, aims to support underprivileged, meritorious students from low-income communities, particularly those who are first-generation learners in their families. This initiative is designed to facilitate access to higher education for these students, enabling them to secure good placements post-graduation. As a result, they can uplift their families from the cycle of poverty, thereby contributing positively to society.

Since its inception, Project Protsaahan has awarded scholarships to 22 students, marking a significant step in institutionalizing support for deserving candidates. The program has been formally in place since the 2019-20 academic year, focusing on students from the Purkal Youth Development Society (PYDS) in Dehradun.
