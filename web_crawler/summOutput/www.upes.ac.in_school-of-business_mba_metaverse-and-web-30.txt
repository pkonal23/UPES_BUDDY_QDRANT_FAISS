The MBA program in Metaverse and Web 3.0 at UPES is designed to prepare students for leadership roles across various industries such as Gaming, E-commerce, Marketing, and Education, both in India and internationally. The program is particularly timely, given that the metaverse job market is forecasted to grow to an $800 billion valuation by 2024, creating approximately 10,000 new jobs over the next five years. Simultaneously, the Web 3.0 blockchain market is evolving towards decentralized technologies, aiming to establish a secure and transparent internet, driven by the demand for decentralized applications (dApps), cryptocurrencies, and blockchain solutions.

The curriculum emphasizes hands-on learning, internships, and real-world case studies to ensure students develop a robust understanding of relevant technologies, including Blockchain, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This practical exposure is vital for enhancing employability in the rapidly expanding fields of Metaverse and Web 3.0.

Students will engage in summer internships and live projects that provide direct experience with Metaverse technologies in business contexts. The program supports collaboration through student and faculty exchanges, research projects, seminars, and conferences, further enriching the learning experience.

The program offers two specializations: one in Web 3.0, which integrates AI, Machine Learning, and Blockchain, and another in Metaverse technology, focusing on the creation of immersive 3D virtual environments. These specializations open doors to diverse career opportunities across sectors such as gaming, e-commerce, and e-learning, positioning the Metaverse as a potentially trillion-dollar industry.

Notably, the job market for graduates in this field is promising, with major companies like Flipkart, Reliance Industries, and HUL actively seeking talent. Roles available to graduates include Chief Metaverse Officer, Metaverse Data Analyst, Virtual Sales Specialist, Metaverse Architect, and many others in both the Metaverse and Web 3.0 domains, such as Blockchain Developers and Web 3.0 Analysts.

The program is structured around three core principles: theoretical knowledge, immersive experiences through dedicated Meta labs, and practical exposure through collaboration with industry partners. This comprehensive approach ensures that students are well-equipped with the necessary skills in virtual and augmented reality design, data management, and business strategy.

To gain admission, prospective students must meet the eligibility criteria, which includes a minimum of 50% marks in Class X, XII, and graduation from a recognized university in any stream.
