Akash Jain and Arsh Bansal, both 4th-year Bachelor of Pharmacy students, have undertaken a project focused on the development of a biosensor specifically designed to detect and quantify the presence of Chlorpyrifos pesticide in milk. Chlorpyrifos is widely utilized in agriculture for pest control; however, its excessive use raises concerns regarding human health, particularly neurotoxic disorders, and environmental pollution.

The students noted the scarcity of research on pesticide detection in milk, prompting them to pursue this project, which they believe has significant potential to address affordability issues related to pesticide testing. Their work has been supported by Dr. Jyoti Upadhyay, an Assistant Professor at the School of Health Sciences and Technology (SOHST), and Dr. Ashish Mathur, a Senior Associate Professor at the Centre for Innovative Drug Research and Development (CIDRI) at UPES. Throughout their research journey, they received extensive guidance from their mentors and the Research & Development (R&D) team, which was crucial given their initial unfamiliarity with the field of biosensors.

For further inquiries or information, the project is associated with the School of Health Sciences and Technology, and Dr. Jyoti Upadhyay can be contacted as a mentor for the project.
