The project titled "RoboBin â€“ A Smart Dustbin" was developed by Alok Singh, a student enrolled in the M.Tech. program in Automation and Robotics Engineering, from the 2021-2023 batch. This innovative project integrates advanced features for waste disposal, combining a navigation system akin to that of a line-following robot with a user detection sensor located on top of the dustbin.

Key functionalities of the RoboBin include:

- **Automatic Lid Operation**: The lid of the dustbin opens automatically when a user approaches to dispose of garbage, thanks to a sensor that detects user presence. After usage, the lid closes automatically, controlled by a servo motor, ensuring that the surrounding environment remains clean and safe when not in use.

- **Navigation and Disposal**: When the dustbin reaches its capacity, it can autonomously move along a predefined path using its wheels. This feature allows it to transport and dispose of litter in larger bins located at a designated area.

The project exemplifies the application of robotics in enhancing waste management systems, contributing to cleaner and more efficient urban environments.
