Neurodiversity encompasses a range of neurological challenges, including those arising from brain injuries or environmental factors. It is recognized that even neurotypical individuals may face mental health issues, with one in four experiencing challenges like depression or stress at some point in their lives. To foster inclusivity in workplaces, progressive employers are beginning to acknowledge the value of accommodating neurodiverse individuals, which can yield significant competitive advantages. This shift has prompted the development of inclusive policies and programs, although changes in workplace design are still emerging.

One notable initiative is a project by design students from UPES, mentored by experts from IBM and IKEA, which has received several accolades including the CII Young Designer Award 2022 and recognition at the Student Service Design Challenge 2022 during Barcelona Design Week. Effective acoustic design in workplaces is essential for supporting diverse activities and ensuring comfort through appropriate sound management. 

Neurodiversity includes variations in neurocognition, covering conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, dyspraxia, and Tourette syndrome. Designing versatile environments can help reduce the visibility of differences among individuals and promote equality. Such designs allow for personal and operational adaptations, enhancing organizational adaptability.

The importance of workplace access to natural daylight is emphasized, as it contributes to physical well-being, mental health, and overall productivity. In recent years, design innovations have surged, driven by creativity and imagination, particularly in product design. 

The article also highlights the challenges neurodiverse individuals face in traditional workplace settings, including sensory sensitivities and difficulties with focus and communication. Companies are encouraged to consider inclusive design as a social responsibility that can enhance workplace culture and financial performance. 

The UPES School of Design offers various programs, including a Bachelor of Design (B.Des) and a Master of Design (M.Des), preparing students for diverse careers in design. The curriculum emphasizes the integration of creativity and technical skills, with students encouraged to pursue internships to bridge academic learning with professional experience.
