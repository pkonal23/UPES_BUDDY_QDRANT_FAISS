Dr. Shubham Dwivedi is a highly accomplished pharmacologist with a specialization in neuropharmacology and behavioral science, focusing particularly on autism spectrum disorder and the interaction between nerve cancer and sympathetic signaling. His academic qualifications include a Ph.D. from BITS-Pilani Hyderabad Campus, where he developed preclinical models for high throughput drug screening targeting autism. He further honed his research skills as a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Anand Krishnan’s lab at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.

Dr. Dwivedi has an extensive publication record, having authored 14 research and review papers in prestigious international journals indexed in SCI and SCOPUS. He is also a reviewer for various international journals, including *Frontiers in Pharmacology*. His notable publications include:

1. Dwivedi, S., et al. (2021). "Sympathetic signaling facilitates the progression of neuroendocrine prostate cancer." *Cell Death Discovery*, 7(1), 1-8.
2. Dwivedi, S., et al. (2019). "Larval zebrafish model for studying the effects of valproic acid on neurodevelopment: An approach towards modeling autism." *Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods*, 95, 56-65.
3. Krishnan, A., Dwivedi, S., et al. (2020). "In vitro, priming response in dorsal root ganglia partially mimics injury-driven pre-conditioning response and reprograms neurons for enhanced outgrowth." *Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience*, 103573.
4. Jangra, A., Dwivedi, S., et al. (2016). "Honokiol abrogates chronic restraint stress-induced cognitive impairment and depressive-like behavior by blocking endoplasmic reticulum stress in the hippocampus of mice." *European Journal of Pharmacology*, 770, 25-32.

In addition to his research contributions, Dr. Dwivedi has been actively involved in academic mentorship, having guided 5 master’s and 1 bachelor’s student, and currently supervising three Ph.D. scholars and two bachelor’s students. His teaching approach emphasizes interactive learning, encouraging students to visualize concepts and engage in discussions to foster a deeper understanding of pharmacology. He employs innovative teaching strategies, such as self-made mnemonics for drug classification and research paper presentations, to enhance student engagement and learning.

Dr. Dwivedi has received several accolades, including travel awards from the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) for poster presentations at significant international conferences. He was also awarded a Senior Research Fellowship (SRF) from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and a Trainee Professional Development Award from the Society for Neuroscience.

His research interests include developing preclinical models for autism, studying neurodevelopmental toxicity, and exploring the role of nerve growth factors in cancer proliferation and metastasis. Dr. Dwivedi is proficient in various experimental techniques, including in vitro cell culture, molecular biology methods, and behavioral studies involving animal models.
