Dr. Jitendra Yadav is a Senior Associate Professor in the Mechanical Engineering department at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES). His academic journey includes significant roles at various institutions, including a tenure as an Assistant Professor at ITM University, Gwalior from September 2010 to June 2014, where he also served as Academic Coordinator, Diploma Program Director, Head of the Mechanical Department, and Associate Head of the Mechanical Department. Prior to this, he held the position of Department Head of Mechanical Engineering at AIT Ujjain and worked as an Assistant Professor at JIT Borawan from January 2001 to March 2010.

Dr. Jitendra's research interests encompass control, modeling & simulation, biofuels, and tribology. His work aims to enhance understanding of complex systems, promote sustainable solutions, and improve energy efficiency. He is particularly focused on the dynamics of friction in tribology, developing a new friction model using a sigmoid function, and correlating the performance of compression ignition (CI) engines running on biofuels with their vibration patterns. His academic contributions include over 30 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, as well as the filing of three Indian Patents and receiving more than ten design registrations from the Government of India.

His educational background includes a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Mechanical Engineering from Shri Govindram Seksaria Institute of Technology and Science in Indore (2000), a Master of Engineering (ME) in Tribology and Maintenance from the same institute (2008), and a PhD from Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal (2016). He has received notable awards, including the Institute of Engineers' 2016 Second Railway Board Prize for one of his papers, and a grant of INR 150,000 for a project on the dynamic analysis of mechanical bolt loosening under varying conditions, funded by UPES in 2020.

Dr. Jitendra has actively participated in faculty development programs, including a one-week Faculty Development Program (FDP) at NITTTR Bhopal in 2016, and has orchestrated over ten such programs. He was part of the inaugural incubation cohort, Runway at UPES, where he secured a grant for prototype development in 2021. His role in academia extends to establishing Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with various industries, bridging the gap between industry and education.

In the classroom, Dr. Jitendra employs a student-centered teaching philosophy, emphasizing the holistic development of learners. He advocates for innovative educational strategies like project-based learning, which can lead to patents and publications. He believes in recognizing the unique talents and needs of each student, fostering an inclusive environment where every learner feels valued.

Currently, he is guiding four Ph.D. students in their research projects and has participated in various academic events, including serving as co-convener for the Doctoral Colloquium DC 2019 at UPES and chairing sessions at international conferences. He has also completed five Coursera module courses on virtual teaching in 2020.
