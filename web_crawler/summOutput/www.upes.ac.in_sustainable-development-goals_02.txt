The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has implemented several major activities and policies aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2), which aims to ensure sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural methods. This goal is focused on ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. It highlights the interconnectedness of food security, nutrition, rural transformation, and sustainable agricultural practices, necessitating a comprehensive approach that considers access to food, nutrition, and sustainable farming.

Key initiatives by UPES include:

1. **Labour School at Kandoli Campus**: UPES operates a Labour School dedicated to Early Childhood Care and Education for the children of construction workers aged 3-8 years. This program not only provides educational support but also ensures that 900 children receive nutritious mid-day meals, contributing to their overall health and well-being.

2. **Increasing Agricultural Productivity**: The university emphasizes the enhancement of agricultural productive capacity in developing nations by advocating for increased investment in plant and livestock gene banks, technological advancements, agricultural research and extension services, and rural infrastructure.

3. **Support for Small-Scale Food Producers**: UPES is committed to doubling the incomes and production of small-scale food producers, particularly focusing on women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, and fishermen. This initiative aims to empower these groups economically and socially.

4. **Genetic Resource Preservation**: The university also aims to preserve genetic diversity in agriculture while ensuring equitable distribution of the benefits derived from genetic resources. 

5. **Combating Malnutrition**: A significant goal under SDG 2 is to eliminate all forms of malnutrition, including meeting internationally agreed-upon targets for stunting and wasting in children under five years old.

Through these initiatives, UPES is actively contributing to the global effort to achieve Zero Hunger and promote sustainable agricultural practices, thereby addressing critical issues related to food security and nutrition.
