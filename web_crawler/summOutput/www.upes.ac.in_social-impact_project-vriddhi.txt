The project titled "Project Vriddhi" is focused on enhancing educational outcomes for primary school students, specifically in the subjects of English and Mathematics. The initiative recognizes that education is a crucial factor in enabling children to reach their full potential, thereby helping to disrupt cycles of poverty and marginalization that can persist across generations. 

The project is led by faculty members from the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), who serve as mentors, and is further supported by student volunteers. This collaborative effort aims to provide high-quality educational support to children, ensuring they have the necessary skills for future success.
