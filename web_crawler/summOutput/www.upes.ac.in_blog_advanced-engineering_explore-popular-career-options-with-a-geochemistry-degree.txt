Geochemistry, a multifaceted discipline, encompasses various branches including organic geochemistry, inorganic geochemistry, and environmental geochemistry. Environmental geochemistry, in particular, focuses on the interactions and distributions of chemical elements in different environmental compartments such as air, soil, and water.

The National Education Policy 2020 has underscored the importance of research and innovation in academia, advocating for increased financial support for academic research initiatives.

Emerging job opportunities are notably present for graduates in aerospace engineering, particularly as the industry evolves with new technologies. Sustainable and renewable energy engineering is also a promising field, with roles available for solar energy system engineers, project managers, and wind farm designers, especially in light of the current energy crisis. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) is revolutionizing the automotive sector, evidenced by a 42% increase in EV sales in India, marking a shift from niche to mainstream.

Educational pathways such as B.Tech programs—both online and on-campus—are available for students to consider. The UPES School of Engineering, for instance, offers a B.Tech in Clean Energy Technologies, equipping graduates with expertise in solar thermal engineering and advanced material physics. The program aims to prepare students for careers that address pressing environmental challenges.

In terms of specialization, the M.Sc. Petroleum Geoscience program at UPES, with a focus on Environmental Geochemistry, is designed to meet the demand for skilled professionals in this field. To pursue a career as a geochemist in India, candidates typically need a background in science at the 10+2 level, followed by a relevant bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree specializing in areas such as Petroleum Geosciences.

Geochemists play a crucial role in various sectors, including oil, mineral, and water exploration, as well as in environmental studies related to climate change and pollution. Their work often involves planning scientific studies, conducting field and lab analyses, and contributing to environmental management policies.

Additionally, the aerospace engineering sector is anticipated to undergo significant transformations with advancements in technology, including the exploration of hydrogen-powered vehicles as the next evolution in sustainable transportation.

For students contemplating their future after a B.Tech degree, options such as pursuing an M.Tech or an MBA are common considerations. The UPES School of Engineering also emphasizes experiential learning through industrial tours and visits to organizations like ISRO and Bharat Dynamics Limited, enhancing students’ practical knowledge and industry readiness.
