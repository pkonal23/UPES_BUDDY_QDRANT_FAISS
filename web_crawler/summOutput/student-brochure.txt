MESSAGE FROM THE

CHANCELLOR

Dr. Sunil Rai
Chancellor
Welcome to UPES - A University whose top priority is to help students fulfill their aspirations and
dreams. We work in tandem with students to design customized educational plans that meet their
individual goals. Among other things, we offer our students a personalized learning environment
with a great deal of flexibility and continuous mentoring. Moreover, we integrate technical knowledge with strong ethics and leadership skills to churn out the best. Educators have always played
an instrumental role in the development and advancement of society and humankind. Despite
their contribution, our world continues to face several challenges re lated to security, environment, energy and health. We believe that educators create a significant impact on overcoming
these challenges and eventually improving the quality of life through their problem-solving abilities, research and innovation. We are living in a period of rapid change with expanding skills and
expertise in several fields across the globe. The present day presents unique opportunities to
produce leaders in various disciplines, who not only advance the knowledge of specific professions but who are also sensitive to protecting the environment and wealth of natural resources
and maintaining equity.
At UPES, we are committed to moulding world-class leaders who make a difference to society.
Our vision is to be recognized for high-quality academic program and research through industry-relevant programs, excellence of our motivated faculty and state-of-the-art facilities that we
provide to students. Our academic programs prepare students better to face new challenges
through stronger ethics and entrepreneurship components. We are committed to giving our
students an environment in which they develop critical-thinking and problem-solving skills.

At UPES, students are guided and motivated to practically implement the principles learnt in
classrooms through experimentation in laboratories, making them confident and skilled professionals. As we strive to be at the forefront of education, we collaborate with and maintain excellent relationship with industries and leading research centers for joint projects, trainings and
internships. This gives our students an edge, which reflects fully in our high placement records
year after year. At UPES, ‘students’ have always been our focus. We are a trustworthy destination
for students aspiring for an innovative career. We believe in the power of education to transform
lives and are committed to making a positive impact to the communities we serve. UPES is more
than just a University – it has become a movement that transforms the lives of youngsters. While
in the initial years, this transformation took place through Petroleum and Energy domain courses,
over the years, we have added Infrastructure, Transportation, IT, Design, Planning and Policy,
Management and Law.
Our programs provide students with excellent opportunities to work closely with faculty members, who are handpicked from premier universities of the world. This enhances the quality of
education and the prospect of getting individual attention. We have a team of dedicated scholars
as members of faculty and experts from the industry as advisors, who create an exciting and
friendly environment conducive for learning. We follow an outcome-based education system.
Whether you are a student, parent or a curious individual, we invite you to visit our campus to
witness the state-of-the-art facilities and excellent teaching-learning atmosphere we are offering.
Our enthusiasm knows no bounds and our dedication to take education to new heights is indeed
strong. Here at UPES, we inspire dreams, ignite curiosity, motivate actions and define the vision
for tomorrow. I am happy that you are considering UPES for your studies and I look forward to
helping you take this exciting step in your life.

MESSAGE FROM THE

VICE CHANCELLOR

Dr. Ram Sharma
Vice Chancellor
My Dear Students,
Welcome to a new journey of learning, growth, and discovery. As you embark on this journey,
remember that every human being has infinite potential. You are capable of achieving greatness
beyond your wildest imagination.
However, this potential cannot be realized without hard work and effort. Remember that every
action or inaction has consequences, and it is up to you to decide which path you want to take.
With dedication and perseverance, you can attain the success you desire. One of the things that
you will learn at the university will be to become independent and assume responsibilities of your
actions or inactions.
Also remember that learning is a lifelong process, and it is never too late to start. You are never
too old or too young to learn something new. So, embrace every opportunity that comes your
way, and never stop exploring.
I would like to share with you a few stories that will inspire you to do great things in life.
The first story is from the Syadvada philosophy of Jainism which is popularly known as “The
Elephant, and Blind Men”. This story teaches us that truth has several facts. We must look at
things from different perspectives before making judgments. We must be open-minded and
willing to listen to others' opinions. The second story is a conversation with Buddha and his disciple Ananda where Buddha tells him “Aatmadipo Bhav” i.e. to become his own light, which tells
us that we can be our own light as well as illuminate the entire world. You have the power to make
a difference in the world, and it starts with believing in yourself.
The third story is from one of my favorite books Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse where the protagonist Siddhartha meets Buddha and asks a few questions to display his intelligence despite knowing that he was talking to an enlightened one. Buddha told him "You are clever, my friend. Be on
your guard against too much of cleverness". This quote reminds us that intelligence alone is not
enough. We must use our intelligence wisely, be on our guard against arrogance of knowing and
not let it cloud our judgment. Let’s always stay humble and hungry for learning.

This is your University’s Orientation
Handbook for the academic year 2023-24. It
is a compilation of things that you will find
useful to know about the life on the campus,
facilities beyond the academic schools and
programs, and the services to make your
stay comfortable and productive.

2) Exemptions
This policy will apply only to social media accounts created for the express purpose of officially
representing University groups, departments, programs, entities, etc. and will not apply to private
social media accounts. University employees acting in an individual capacity should exercise
caution to communicate clearly that they are not acting in a representative capacity, or expressing
the views of the University.

3) Deﬁnitions
Poster or User: A person submitting content to any social media site that is officially recognized by
UPES. Social Media: Social media is media designed to be disseminated through social interaction
using highly accessible and scalable publishing techniques. Social media uses Internet and
web-based technologies to transform how people communicate with one another and receive
news, information and entertainment. Social media has transformed people from content
consumers to content producers. Types of social media include networks like Facebook, YouTube
and Yammer but also include blogs and podcasts.
Social Media Accounts: These are accounts or profiles created in social media outlets such as
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and LinkedIn.
Social Media Best Practices: These consist of widely recognized guidelines, ethical considerations,
and conventions for creating successful social media campaigns and accounts.
Social media Staff: Members of the Social media staff are from the Corporate communication
department of the University
The purpose of these staff is to help UPES create, manage and succeed in using social media
outlets to further their academic mission. The Social Media Staff will identify individuals and
groups that currently manage social media accounts for UPES entities, advise them on the policy,
and encourage those who have not done so to apply for official recognition status. The staff will
provide occasional training sessions regarding social media use and its role at UPES.
Social Media Terms and Conditions: The terms and conditions imposed by the social media
website in which the User is participating.
University's best interest: To represent the University in a fair, accurate and legal manner while
protecting the brand and reputation of the institution.
3) Procedures and Responsibilities
A. Use of Social Media Sites for General Business, Marketing and Communications
1. The Director – Marketing and Corporate Communication department will be responsible for
administering this policy.
2. The Social Media Policy Staff will manage the day-to-day application process and update the
UPES website web page and account directory as needed.
3. All social media accounts officially recognized by UPES must have at least two UPES
employees as administrators at all times to ensure adherence to this policy.
4. Should a UPES employee administrator of an account leave the University for any reason or
no longer wishes to be an account administrator, it is the Director - Marketing / Corporate
Commnications department's responsibility to designate another employee to be an account
administrator and remove the former employee's administrative permissions to the site.
Whenever possible, a department should appoint two individuals to act concurrently as
account administrators for a social media site representing UPES.
5. If two employees are not available to serve as account administrators, a member of the
Social Media Staff may serve in that capacity.

Employees / students identified as administrators of accounts are responsible for managing and
monitoring content of their social media accounts. Administrators are responsible to remove
content that may violate the University Acceptable IT Policies or the Terms and Conditions of use.
1) Guidelines for Content:
a) Users are expected to adhere to same standards of conduct online as they would in the
workplace. Laws and policies respecting contracting and conflict of interest, as well as
applicable policies and guidelines for interacting with students, parents, alumni, media and
all other University constituents apply online and in the social media context just as they do in
personal interactions. Users are fully responsible forwhat they post to social media sites.
b) Use good judgment about content and respect privacy laws. Do not include confidential
information about the University, its staff, or its students.
Post only content that is not threatening, obscene, a violation of intellectual property rights or
privacy laws, or otherwise injurious or illegal.
f) When using or posting online material that includes direct or paraphrased quotes, thoughts,
ideas, photos, or videos, always include citations. Provide a link to the original material if
applicable.
g) Refrain from using information and conducting activities that may violate University or
Government rules and regulations.
h) If you also maintain your own personal social media accounts, you should avoid creating
confusion over whether or not the account is associated with UPES. If you identify yourself as a
University student, faculty or staff member online, it should be clear that the views expressed
on your site are not those of the University and you are not acting in your capacity as a UPES
employee or student. While not a requirement, UPES employees may consider adding the
following disclaimer to personal social media accounts.“While I am an employee / student at
the University of Petroleum & Energy Studies, comments made on this account are my own and
not those of the University.”
Enforcement

i. Users found violating this policy may be denied access to University computing resources
and may be subject to other penalties and disciplinary action, including possible expulsion
or dismissal.
ii. Alleged violations will be handled through the University disciplinary procedures
applicable to the user.
iii. The University may suspend, block or restrict access to an account, independent of such
procedures, when it reasonably appears necessary to do so in order to protect the
integrity, security, or functionality of University or other computing resources or to
protect the University from liability.
iv. The University may also refer suspected violations of applicable law to appropriate law
enforcement agencies.

Best Practices for Social Media
In addition, the following general guidelines apply for social media usage to all users in the
University: Sharing University news, events or promoting faculty and student work through social
media tools is a excellent, low-cost way to engage the community and build our brand.
Employees and students are encouraged to repost and share information with their family and
friends that is available to the public (press releases, articles in the University record, etc.). The
best way to share University news is to link to the original source. When sharing information that
is not a matter of public record, please follow the below guidelines.

public record, please follow the below guidelines.
Maintain Confidentiality
Do not post confidential or proprietary information about the University, its students, its alumni or
your fellow employees. Use good ethical judgment and follow University policies.
Maintain Privacy
Do not discuss a situation involving named or pictured individuals on a social media site without
their permission. As a guideline, do not post anything that you would not present in any public
forum.
Respect University Time and Property

It's appropriate to post at work if your comments are directly related to accomplishing work
goals, such as seeking sources for information or working with others to resolve a problem. You
should participate in personal social media conversations on your own time.
Do No Harm
Let your Internet social networking do no harm to the University or to yourself whether you're
navigating those networks on the job or off.
Understand Your Personal Responsibility
University employees and students are personally responsible for the content they publish on
blogs, Facebook, Twitter or any other form of user-generated content. Be mindful that what you
publish will be public for a long time— protect your privacy.
Be Aware of Liability
You are responsible for what you post on your own site and on the sites of others. Individual
bloggers have been held liable for commentary deemed to be copyright infringement,
defamatory, proprietary, libelous or obscene (as defined by the courts). Increasingly, employers
are conducting Web searches on job candidates before extending offers. Be sure that what you
post today will not come back to haunt you.
Maintain Transparency
The line between professional and personal business is sometimes blurred: Be thoughtful about
your posting as content and potential audiences. Be honest about your identity. In personal
posts, you may identify yourself as a University faculty or staff member. However, please be clear
that you are sharing your views as an individual, not as a representative of the University of
Petroleum & Energy Studies.
Correct Mistakes
If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If you're posting
to a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post—just make it clear that you have done so
Respect
Others You are more likely to achieve your goals or sway others to your beliefs if you are
constructive and respectful while discussing a bad experience or disagreeing with a concept or
person.
Be a Valued Member
If you join a social network, make sure you are contributing valuable insights. Don't hijack the
discussion and redirect by posting self/organizational promoting information. Self-promoting
behavior is viewed negatively and can lead to you being banned from Websites or groups.

There's no such thing as a “private” social media site. Search engines can turn up posts and
pictures years after the publication date. Comments can be forwarded or copied. Archival
systems save information even if you delete a post. If you feel angry or passionate about a
subject, it's wise to delay posting until you are calm and clear-headed. Post only pictures that you
would be comfortable sharing with the gener- al public (current and future peers, employers,
etc.).
SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDELINES WHEN POSTING AS AN INDIVIDUAL
UPES uses social media to supplement traditional press and marketing efforts. Employees are
encouraged to share University news and events, which are a matter of public record, with their
family and friends. Linking straight to the information source is an effective way to help promote
the mission of the University and build community. When you might be perceived online as an
agent/expert of UPES, you need to make sure it is clear to the audience that you are not representing the position of UPES or UPES policy. While the guidelines below apply only to those
instances where there is the potential for confusion about your role as a UPES agent/expert
versus personal opinion, they are good to keep in mind for all social media interactions. When
posting to a social media site you should:
Be Authentic
Be honest about your identity. In personal posts, you may identify yourself as a UPES faculty or
staff member. However, please be clear that you are sharing your personal views and are not
speaking as a formal representative of UPES. If you identify yourself as a member of the UPES
community, ensure your profile and related content are consistent with how you wish to present
yourself to colleagues.
Use a Disclaimer
If you publish content to any website outside of UPES and it has something to do with the work
you do or subjects associated with UPES, use a disclaimer such as this: “The postings on this site
are my own and do not represent UPES's positions, strategies or opinions.”
Don't Use the UPES Logo or Make Endorsements
Do not use the University logo or any other marks or images on your personal online sites. Do
not use UPES's name to promote or endorse any product, cause or political party or candidate.
Take the High Ground.
If you identify your affiliation with UPES in your comments, readers may associate you with the
University, even with the disclaimer that your views are your own. Remember that you're most
likely to build a high-quality following if you discuss ideas and situations civilly. Don't Use
Pseudonyms.

Never pretend to be someone else. Tracking tools enable supposedly anonymous posts to be
traced back to their authors.
Protect Your Identity
While you should be honest about yourself, don't provide personal information that scam artists
or identity thieves could use. Don't list your home address or telephone number. It is a good idea
to create a separate e-mail address that is used only with social media sites.
Does it Pass the Publicity Test
content of your message would not be acceptable for face-to-face conversation, over the telephone, or in another medium, it will not be acceptable for a social networking site. Ask yourself,
would I want to see this published in the newspaper or posted on a hoarding tomorrow or ten
years from now?
Respect Your Audience
Don't use slurs, personal insults, obscenity, or engage in any conduct that would not be acceptable in the UPES community. You should also show proper consideration for others' privacy and
for topics that may be considered sensitive —such as politics and religion.
Monitor Comments
Most people who maintain social media sites welcome comments— it builds credibility and
community. However, you may be able to set your site so that you can review and approve comments before they appear. This allows you to respond in a timely way to comments. It also allows
you to delete spam com- ments and to block any individuals who repeatedly post offensive or
frivolous comments. A common practice among individuals who write about the industry in
which they work is to include a disclaimer on their site, usually on their “About Me” page. If you
discuss higher education on your own social media site, we suggest you include a sentence similar to this: “The views expressed on this [blog, Web site] are mine alone and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the University.” This is particularly important if you could be perceived to be
in a leadership role at UPES.
SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDELINES WHEN POSTING ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
PETROLEUM AND ENERGY STUDIES
Online collaboration tools provide low-cost communication methods which Seek Approval

Any messages that might act as the “voice” or position of the university or a university entity
must be approved by the university or the Dean/Director/Head of function of that entity or their
delegate.
Be Accurate
Make sure that you have all the facts before you post. It's better to verify information with a
source first than to have to post a correction or retraction later. Cite and link to your sources
whenever possible, that's how you build community.
Be Transparent
If you participate in or maintain a social media site on behalf of the university, clearly state your
role and goals. Keep in mind that if you are posting with a university username, other users do
not know you personally. They view what you post as coming from the university. Be careful and
be respectful. What you say directly reflects on the university. Discuss with your supervisor the
circumstances in which you are empowered to respond directly to users and when you may need
approval.
Be Timely
Assign an administrator who can regularly monitor postings and content. Aim for standard times
for postings and updates. The recommended minimum frequency is once to twice a week. But
be sure not to overload your updates. Followers will stop paying attention if you overload them
with information.
Be Responsible
What you write is ultimately your responsibility. Participation in social computing on behalf of
UPES is not a right but an opportunity, so please treat it seriously and with respect. If you want
to participate on behalf of the university, be sure to abide by its standard practice guidelines.
Respect Others
Users are free to discuss topics and disagree with one another, but please be respectful of
others' opin- ions. You are more likely to achieve your goals if you are constructive and respectful
while discussing a bad experience or disagreeing with a concept or person.
Be a Valued Member
If you join a social network like a Facebook group or comment on someone's blog, make sure
you are contributing valuable insights. Post information about topics like UPES events or a book
you've authored only when you are sure it will be of interest to readers. In some forums, self-promoting behavior is viewed negatively and can lead to you being banned from websites or
groups.

SAFETY & PRIVACY TIPS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKING

The internet is open to a worldwide audience. When using social media channels, ask yourself:
1. Did I set my privacy setting to help control who can look at my profile, personal information
and photos? You can limit access somewhat but not completely, and you have no control over
what someone else may share.
2. How much information do I want strangers to know about me? If I give them my cell phone
number, address, e-mail, class schedule, a list of possessions (such as my CD collection) how
might they use it? With whom will they share it? Not everyone will respect your personal or
physical space.
3. Is the image I'm projecting by my materials and photos the one I want my current and future
friends to know me by? What does my profile say to potential faculty members/advisors?
Future graduate school/internship interviewers? Potential employers? Neighbors? Family?
Parents? Which doors am I opening and which am I closing?
4. What if I change my mind about what I post? For instance, what if I want to remove something
I posted as a joke or to make a point? Have I read the social networking site's privacy and caching statements? Removing material from network caches can be difficult. Posted material can
remain accessible on the internet until you've completed the prescribed process for removing
information from the caching technology of one or multiple (potentially unknown) search
engines.
5. Have I asked permission to post someone else's image or information? Am I infringing on their
privacy? Could I be hurting someone? Could I be subject to defamation suits? Am I violating
network use policy?
6. Does my equipment have spyware and virus protections installed? Some sites collect profile
information to SPAM you. Others contain links that can infect your equipment with viruses that
potentially can destroy data and infect others with whom you communicate. Remember to
back up your work on an external source in case of destructive attacks.
Amplification note to the Social Media Policy and Code of Conduct for Students/introduction at
University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, we realize that part of 21st-century learning is adapting to changing methods of communication. The importance of faculty members, students and
parents engag- ing, collaborating, learning, and sharing in these digital environments is a part of
21st-century learning. In recognition of this, UPES has developed the following policy to provide
direction for the UPES students, staff, alumni and parent community when participating in online
social media activities.
Due to the plethora of new social media tools available to students, student's intellect produce
and documents have the potential to reach audiences far beyond the classroom. This translates
into the need for a greater level of awareness, responsibility, and accountability for all users.
Below are the guidelines for UPES students to follow when using social media.

A. Guiding Parameters (Merriam-Webster Online)
Forms of electronic communication (as Web sites for social networking and microblogging)
through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (as videos).
Common examples of such social media forums include Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, My Space,
YouTube, Google, WhatsApp, Watts Chat, etc., and the list grows steadily.Key Principle
Interacting with each other online is no different than interacting face-to-face. We are required to
main- tain the principles of respect, dignity, prudence, concern for and protection of others, and
safety in all interactions.
Activities which are inappropriate, unethical, illegal, or which cause undue discomfort for members of the UPES community (including students, employees, parents, or others) should be judiciously avoided in written communications, and cyberspace. Students who participate in online
interactions must remember that their posts reflect on the entire UPES community and to the
world at large, are subject to the same behavioral standards set forth in the Student Code of Conduct as given in the Student Bulletin.
B.

Code of Conduct

Every type of online interactions, using any electronic media, i.e., mobile phones, i-pads, and
computing devices will be covered under Code of Conduct laid down herewith.
1. Be aware of what you post online. Social media venues are very public. What you contribute
leaves a permanent digital footprint for all to see. Do not post anything you would not want
friends, enemies, parents, teachers, or a future employer to see, as you cannot control posted
data once it is on the Web.
2. How you represent yourself online is an extension of yourself. Do not misrepresent yourself by
using someone else's identity.
3. “Common E-Mail Ids” (CEI) – CEIs are email ids whose password is shared by a large number
of students/faculty members. There is no mechanism to identify and control the password possession and spread of these mail IDs. Therefore, finding out / fixing the ownership of e-mailed
material of the actual person who sends mails using CEIs is impossible.
UPES policies and systems in place do not mandate creation of such CEIs.The creation and
operation of CEIs is by individuals, and UPES is not liable for any harm/damage caused to
anyone through mail sent using these mail ids. Therefore, students will not create CEIs, and
dismantle them if already created. Members of faculty and staff are required not to use communication with students. For communication between a member of faculty and student’s personal/official email IDs is recommended that specifically identifies the student and faculty.
Also, for all academic purposes effective and comprehensive usage of LMS is strictly recommended. Usage/creation of CEIs is an offence covered under the aforesaid regulations.
4. As an amplification of cyber laws / IT Policy of UPES, following acts of omission and commission by students are forbidden. Implicit or explicit indulgence in such acts will constitute violation of UPES IT Policy and Regulation 5 (c ) xxiii of UPES Regulations Governing Maintenance
of Discipline Among Students wherein the following would be included as major acts of indiscipline:-

•

Creating or getting created digital video recordings/ photographs of UPES community members either on-campus or at off-campus UPES events for online publication or distribution
without their consent/ authorization.

•

Using social media sites to publish abusive, disparaging or harassing remarks about UPES
students, staff, and faculty members, athletic or academic contest rivals, etc.

•

Using social media for instigating, initiating, and furtherance of student unrest in forms of
bunking of classes, collecting students at a location, strike, demonstrations, and slogans
against UPES.

•

Using inappropriate abusive, loose and degrading language on social media forums.

•

Posting/uploading teaching material – notes, power point presentations, copy of case studies,
student advisory, caution letter, penalty letter, etc., provided to them by faculty members /
University on internet without the authorization from respective faculty members/ UPES
authorities.

•

Starting public pages, groups on social networking forums that include University’s Name, and
Logo without the permission of UPES authorities.

•

Using the UPES name, logo, uniform, photos or other intellectual property (documents produced by the University or students) when creating independent groups, Fan pages, or on
one's own site, without first obtaining permission from the University.

•

In cases of students anonymously posting contents on social media, mails, Web pages and
other online forums, the University reserves the right to technologically investigate using
Cyber Law Enforcement Agencies to find out Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of such anonymous users, and fix the responsibility of content posted by them.

•

Failure to abide by this policy, as with other policies at UPES, will result in disciplinary action
as described in the Student Bulletin, or as determined by the University Administration.

•

The use of social media (Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, etc.) is not permitted during class time
unless specifically authorized by the faculty member.
While investigating the cases involving alleged or reported violation of cyber laws/ social
media policy, or code of conduct of UPES students, the UPES authority – The Registrar or
her/his representative, and the School Proctors are empowered to confiscate the communication devise from the student, and examine it. Refusal on part of the student to surrender
his/her communication devise, or altering its contents before surrendering it will be deemed
to be gross violation of Code of Conduct.

C. Privacy
1. Exercise care with privacy settings and personal profile content, to ensure that posted content
does not reflect poorly on the UPES in any way or otherwise create a conflict of interest. Content should be placed thoughtfully and periodically reviewed.
2. On most sites, privacy settings can be changed at any time to limit access to profiles and
searchability, and changes should be made when necessary.

3. To make it difficult for others to access information about your private life, make certain that
yourpersonal social networking profile is set to "private" and that personal information is not
available to "friends of friends" or other peripheral contacts.
4. Be safe online. Never give out personal information, including, but not limited to, last names,
phone numbers, addresses, exact birth dates, and pictures. Do not share your password with
anyone including your friends, teachers and parents.
5. Always respect the privacy of others.
D. Content
1. Due to the fact that social media sites are increasingly inter connected, you should be aware
that any content posted online may eventually (or immediately) show up on other sites. Not
posting inappropriate content in the first place is the only way to completely protect against
this possibility.
2. Follow the UPES Code of Conduct when writing online. It is acceptable to disagree with someone else's opinions; however, do it in a respectful way. Make sure that criticism is constructive
and not hurtful. What is inappropriate in the classroom is inappropriate online.
3. Linking to other websites to support your thoughts and ideas is recommended. However, be
sure to read the entire article prior to linking to ensure that all information is appropriate for a
school setting.
4. Do your own work! Do not use other people's intellectual property without their permission.
It is a violation of copyright law to copy and paste other's thoughts. When paraphrasing someone else's idea(s) be sure to cite your source with the URL. It is good practice to hyperlink to
your sources.
5. Students who choose to post editorial content to websites or other forms of online media
including online queries by prospective students or employers must ensure that their submission does not reflect poorly upon the University.
6. Be aware that pictures may also be protected under copyright laws. Verify you have permission to use the image or it is under Creative Commons attribution.
7. Blog and wiki posts should be well written. Follow writing conventions including proper grammar, capitalization, and punctuation. If you edit someone else's work be sure it is in the spirit
of improving the writing.
Students who do not abide by these terms and conditions may lose their access to online tools
and be subject to further disciplinary action.
