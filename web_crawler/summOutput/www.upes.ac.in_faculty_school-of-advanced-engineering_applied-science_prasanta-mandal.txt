His academic journey includes a prestigious fellowship from IIT Kharagpur for his MTech, where he achieved an All India Rank (AIR) of 44 in GATE-2000. He was awarded a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Fellowship (JRF and SRF) from 2002 to 2007, enabling him to pursue a PhD at IIT Bombay, which he completed in 2008. His postdoctoral research experience spans approximately 5 years, including roles as a visiting scientist at TIFR Mumbai, a postdoctoral fellow at Ajou University in South Korea, and a project scientist at IIT Kanpur.

Dr. Mandal has a robust research profile, having published over 50 research articles, including peer-reviewed journal publications and refereed proceedings, which have garnered more than 750 citations. His notable metrics include an h-index of 15 and an i10-index of 19, with 9 sole-authored publications and 3 review articles in high-impact journals. He is recognized as an international referee for various prestigious journals, such as Scientific Reports, Optics Express, and SPIE Nanophotonic.

Currently, Dr. Mandal leads a SERB-funded project titled “All-metal plasmonic perfect absorber metamaterial structures to capture visible-NIR radiation: Computational study and experimental feasibility,” which runs from 2020 to 2023 with a funding value of ₹18.8 Lakhs. His research interests focus on plasmonic and photonic metamaterials, SERS spectroscopy, solar energy harvesting, and the development of optical devices for radiation detection and manipulation. He employs advanced nanofabrication techniques, including laser interference lithography and electron beam lithography, in his research.

In recognition of his contributions, Dr. Mandal received the UPES Best Researcher Award in 2020 and has been involved in organizing various research meetings and national/international conferences. He is also a permanent member of the Indian Physics Association and is currently guiding several doctoral students.

Dr. Mandal teaches a range of undergraduate and graduate courses, including Engineering Physics, Waves and Oscillations, Atomic, Molecular, and Laser Physics, Quantum Mechanics, and Photonics. His teaching philosophy emphasizes a learner-centric approach, incorporating both audio-visual and traditional learning methods to foster understanding and creativity rather than rote memorization.
