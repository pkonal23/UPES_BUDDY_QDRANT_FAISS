The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) has partnered with Infosys to modernize its B.Tech. in Geo Informatics Engineering program. This collaboration involves the integration of industry-specific modules and best practices into the curriculum, enhancing the educational experience with real-world applications.

As part of this initiative, subject matter experts from Infosys are responsible for teaching select course modules, ensuring that students receive up-to-date knowledge and skills relevant to the industry. Additionally, Infosys facilitates the training of UPES faculty through its ‘Faculty Internship Program’ during semester breaks, allowing educators to gain practical insights into the industry.

The partnership also provides opportunities for students to intern at Infosys during the summer, further bridging the gap between academic learning and industry experience. The Infosys Oil and Gas Practice plays a crucial role in this collaboration by offering geographic information system (GIS) solutions that help organizations manage, store, and extract value from location-based data. These GIS-enabled solutions are designed to streamline business processes, enhance productivity, and potentially reduce operational costs by up to 50%.
