UPES (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies) is distinguished for its mandatory six-week social internship program called Srijan, which is offered to all first-year students across various fields of study. This initiative emphasizes the importance of social engagement in education, aiming to instill a sense of social purpose early in students' academic journeys. The program is designed to enhance students' understanding of societal challenges, thereby fostering empathy and leadership skills.

Srijan social internships allow students to gain firsthand experience in the social sector, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Students will work on assigned projects within non-profit organizations, guided by mentors and supported by UPES faculty through readings and assignments that enrich the internship experience. This exposure is crucial for students, as it introduces them to grassroots realities and the complexities of social inequalities, such as access to basic necessities.

The program also includes preparatory courses and masterclasses with professionals in the social sector, ensuring that students are well-equipped to tackle social issues before they embark on their internships. Following their internships, students will participate in a campus-wide social fair to share their experiences and insights with the university community.

Prof. Rahul Nainwal, Director of the School of Business at UPES, emphasizes that such internships are vital for nurturing students who are not only academically proficient but also socially aware and capable of contributing positively to society. The overarching goal of these internships is to cultivate future change-makers and compassionate leaders, ready to address local and global challenges.
