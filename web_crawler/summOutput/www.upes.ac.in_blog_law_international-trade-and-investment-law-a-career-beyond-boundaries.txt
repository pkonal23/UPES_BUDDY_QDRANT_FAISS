The content discusses essential traits for successful corporate lawyers and highlights the educational offerings of the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) in India, particularly in the field of International Trade and Investment Law (ITIL). UPES is the first Indian university to collaborate with The University of Law in the UK, providing a BBA LL.B. (Hons.) program that focuses on this specialization.

Key historical context is provided regarding the evolution of trade laws, beginning with medieval commercial laws, Lex Mercatoria and Lex Maritima, and progressing to the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947. This marked the beginning of modern trade laws aimed at reducing trade barriers, culminating in the formation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. The WTO has since played a crucial role in facilitating international trade and resolving disputes through its active dispute settlement mechanism.

The article emphasizes the increasing demand for lawyers with specialized knowledge in international law from government organizations and multinational companies. It stresses the importance of skills such as debating, logical argumentation, and legal writing, which are vital in the legal profession. The UPES School of Law prepares students for careers in law through a rigorous curriculum, experiential learning opportunities like moot courts, and engagement with legal professionals.

Career prospects for graduates specializing in ITIL are highlighted, including roles in international organizations, government ministries, and private firms. The text also touches on the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) on the legal profession, suggesting that a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree with a focus on these technologies can enhance career opportunities.

In conclusion, the article presents UPES as a leading institution for aspiring lawyers, particularly in the area of International Trade and Investment Law, while underscoring the critical skills and knowledge required to succeed in the corporate legal landscape.
