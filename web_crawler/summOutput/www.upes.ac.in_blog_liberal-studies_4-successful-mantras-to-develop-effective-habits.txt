The content discusses the essential traits and effective habits that successful corporate lawyers should possess, particularly focusing on the importance of building positive habits. It highlights that many successful corporate lawyers share common routines, such as waking up early (between 6 and 7 am), exercising, and reading motivational literature in the morning. These habits contribute significantly to their success and are sought after by government organizations, private firms, and multinational companies looking for dynamic legal professionals with expertise in international law.

To cultivate effective habits, the text suggests a strategic approach, emphasizing the importance of rewarding oneself for taking action towards forming new habits. This creates a positive feedback loop that encourages the repetition of desired behaviors. The author outlines four key steps to habit formation:

1. **Make it Obvious**: Clearly define the new habit and set a fixed time and location for it.
2. **Make it Attractive**: Attach enjoyable elements or rewards to the habit to enhance motivation.
3. **Make it Easy**: Start with small, manageable actions, gradually increasing their complexity and duration as the habit becomes ingrained.
4. **Make it Satisfying**: Ensure that there is a sense of satisfaction or reward associated with completing the habit, reinforcing the behavior.

The content also touches on the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the legal profession, suggesting that an LL.M. with a specialization in these areas can provide students with a competitive edge in the evolving law-tech landscape.

Moreover, it discusses the career prospects available to law graduates, particularly those specializing in international trade, investment law, and criminal law, as well as the implications of allowing foreign law firms to practice in India.

The piece concludes by underscoring the significance of developing effective habits for personal and professional success, encouraging law students and aspiring lawyers to adopt these strategies in their daily lives.
