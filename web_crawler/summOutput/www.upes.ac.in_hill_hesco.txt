HESCO, or the Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organization, is fundamentally rooted in rural development. The organization draws inspiration from village life and creates tailored solutions to address the specific challenges faced by these communities. HESCO's initiatives are designed to empower rural populations by emphasizing their economic and developmental needs. It encourages the utilization of local resources, which facilitates self-reliance and opens new pathways for sustainable development.
