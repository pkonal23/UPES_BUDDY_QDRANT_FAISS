The University Grants Commission (UGC) has established an Expert Panel Member Board dedicated to the assessment of various research schemes. Among the notable faculty achievements highlighted is that of Dr. Sumeet Gupta, who has received the Dr. D.S. Kothari Research Grant aimed at newly recruited faculty members. Additionally, there is a research grant available for in-service faculty members, as well as a fellowship specifically designed for superannuated faculty members.

The eligibility criteria for these grants and fellowships are likely outlined by the UGC, ensuring that faculty members meet specific requirements before applying. Furthermore, the School of Business is mentioned, suggesting that these opportunities may be applicable or relevant to faculty within this department.

For further inquiries or detailed information regarding the grants and fellowships, interested individuals should refer to the UGCâ€™s official communications or website, which would provide comprehensive guidelines and contact details for assistance.
