A recent report by McKinsey highlights the transformative potential of Generative AI, suggesting that it could significantly enhance global productivity, potentially adding trillions of dollars to the economy. The report predicts that by 2030 to 2060, approximately half of current work activities may be automated, with a midpoint forecasted around 2045. Despite India's strong AI talent pool, it lags behind several key global tech hubs in the Generative AI sector, emphasizing the need for investment in skill development for innovators.

The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), a UGC-recognized private university established by the UPES Act of 2003 in Uttarakhand, is responding to this need by offering a variety of graduate and postgraduate programs across eight schools, including the School of Advanced Engineering, School of Computer Science, and School of Business, among others. UPES boasts around 13,000 students and over 1,500 faculty and staff members. According to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2023, UPES is ranked 52 overall, 54 in engineering, and 39 in management. Additionally, it has been recognized by QS World University Rankings 2024 as the top private university in academic reputation in India, placing it among the top 3% of universities globally. The university has also achieved an 'A' grade accreditation from NAAC and received a 5-Star rating for employability, with placement rates exceeding 90% in recent years.

To further its commitment to research and innovation in AI, UPES is establishing a state-of-the-art Center of Excellence in AI and Data Sciences, with an investment of INR 50 crores. This center will facilitate multi-disciplinary research, consulting, and training, equipped with high-end servers, GPUs, and TPUs, allowing over 50 researchers to collaborate simultaneously. The center will also offer interdisciplinary master's and research programs in Data Sciences and AI, focusing on practical applications in sectors such as BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance), Healthcare, Defense, and Manufacturing. 

Dr. Ravi S. Iyer, Dean of the School of Computer Science at UPES, emphasizes the university's goal to contribute to fundamental AI research and its application, providing hands-on experience for students and collaborating with various sectors to address real-life challenges.
