The B.Tech. Civil Engineering course offered by UPES School of Engineering is designed to prepare students for the dynamic field of civil engineering, particularly focusing on the development of smart cities and sustainable infrastructure. The curriculum emphasizes the integration of technology in urban living, covering areas such as intelligent transportation systems and energy-efficient buildings. The course spans four years, divided into eight semesters, and includes specialized tracks in Transportation Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Construction Management.

A unique dual-degree option allows students to spend two years at UPES and two years at prestigious international universities, including the University of Exeter, University of Aberdeen, and Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). This global exposure is complemented by a focus on emerging technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), which enhance project planning and execution.

The program also addresses contemporary challenges in civil engineering, including climate change and the need for resilient infrastructure. Students learn about innovative solutions like flood-resistant designs and sustainable drainage systems, equipping them to tackle environmental issues effectively. Additionally, the curriculum incorporates advanced construction materials, such as self-healing concrete, and integrates immersive technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) for enhanced learning experiences.

Furthermore, the course aligns with the National Education Policy 2020's emphasis on research and innovation, encouraging students to engage in academic research with financial support. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen-powered vehicles is also a key focus, highlighting the importance of sustainable engineering practices.

Career prospects for graduates are broad, with opportunities in fields such as solar energy, wind farm design, and project management in the renewable energy sector. The course also prepares students for advanced studies, such as M.Tech. or MBA, ensuring they are well-equipped to make informed decisions about their future.

In summary, UPES's B.Tech. Civil Engineering program not only provides foundational knowledge but also emphasizes practical experience and global exposure, preparing students to lead in the evolving landscape of civil engineering and contribute to sustainable urban development.
