Deon Joseph Kurian is a B.Des. student specializing in Interior & Retail Space Design, part of the 2018-2022 cohort. He successfully completed a project focused on creating a novel retail concept for The Indian Avatar, a prominent traditional clothing brand with over 50 stores across India. The project's aim was to design an exceptional shopping environment that aligns with the brandâ€™s values and Indian heritage, particularly catering to contemporary professional women. Kurian's contributions included the conceptualization of new fixture collections and a retail strategy that offers a welcoming and relatable shopping experience while maintaining the essence of the brand. This initiative not only enhances the customer experience but also lays the groundwork for the brand's future expansion.

In a related initiative, Siddhartha Mukherjee is working towards establishing a care center for children aged 6 to 10 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) near Pondha Village in Dehradun. The innovative design will utilize shipping containers for construction and will include both residential and therapy spaces, creating a holistic environment aimed at supporting the growth and development of children with ASD.
