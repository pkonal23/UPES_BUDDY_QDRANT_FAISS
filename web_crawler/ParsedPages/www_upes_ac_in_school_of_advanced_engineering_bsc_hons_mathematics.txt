Program Details
The
B. Sc. Mathematics
program offered by UPES School of Advanced Engineering is a comprehensive 3-year course falling under the Applied Science Cluster. It provides students with a flexible and dynamic curriculum, aligned with the NEP 2020 framework, enabling them to customize their education according to their individual interests and career aspirations. The program is divided into 8 semesters, and each semester encompasses courses worth a maximum of 20 credits.
One of the key highlights of this program is the provision of multiple exit and entry options. After completing 40 credits in a year, students have the option to exit with a certificate in the respective discipline. Similarly, after earning 80 credits in two years, students can choose to take an exit with a diploma. Furthermore, those who accumulate 120 credits in three years are eligible to receive a UG degree in the given discipline. The program culminates in the fourth year, where students have the opportunity to earn a B. Sc., depending on their preferences and choices.
As part of the program, students will also have the option to specialize in Data Science & Computational Mathematics through electives and additional courses. In the final year, students will undergo research-specific courses to prepare for their dissertations. Moreover, the program allows for lateral entry, adhering to the NEP 2020 regulations, which enables students to join the course at a later stage if they have prior qualifying credits. An additional benefit is that after completing the 3-year UG degree, students can directly pursue a PhD with coursework both in India and abroad, opening up further avenues for advanced research and academic pursuits.

Program Details
The
B. Sc. Mathematics
program offered by UPES School of Advanced Engineering is a comprehensive 3-year course falling under the Applied Science Cluster. It provides students with a flexible and dynamic curriculum, aligned with the NEP 2020 framework, enabling them to customize their education according to their individual interests and career aspirations. The program is divided into 8 semesters, and each semester encompasses courses worth a maximum of 20 credits.
One of the key highlights of this program is the provision of multiple exit and entry options. After completing 40 credits in a year, students have the option to exit with a certificate in the respective discipline. Similarly, after earning 80 credits in two years, students can choose to take an exit with a diploma. Furthermore, those who accumulate 120 credits in three years are eligible to receive a UG degree in the given discipline. The program culminates in the fourth year, where students have the opportunity to earn a B. Sc., depending on their preferences and choices.
As part of the program, students will also have the option to specialize in Data Science & Computational Mathematics through electives and additional courses. In the final year, students will undergo research-specific courses to prepare for their dissertations. Moreover, the program allows for lateral entry, adhering to the NEP 2020 regulations, which enables students to join the course at a later stage if they have prior qualifying credits. An additional benefit is that after completing the 3-year UG degree, students can directly pursue a PhD with coursework both in India and abroad, opening up further avenues for advanced research and academic pursuits.
