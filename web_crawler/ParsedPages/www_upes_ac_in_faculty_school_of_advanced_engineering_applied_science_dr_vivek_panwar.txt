Dr. Vivek Panwar

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Vivek Panwar is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UPES University. With a robust academic background and a passion for both teaching and research, Dr. Vivek has made significant contributions to the field of mathematics. Dr. Vivek has academic history as Doctorate from an international University, South Asian University, Delhi specializing with Integral transforms. M.Sc Applied Mathematics from South Asian University and
B.Sc with Mathematics honours from University of Delhi.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Dr. Vivek Panwar was at the school of basic science of the Manipal University Jaipur, held a position of assistant professor at the department of Mathematics. He also worked for Akal University Telwandi Sabo, Bhatindha.
