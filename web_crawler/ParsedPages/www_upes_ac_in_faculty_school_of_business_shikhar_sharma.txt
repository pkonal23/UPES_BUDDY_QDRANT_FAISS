Teaching Philosophy
Prof. Shikhar’s teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that it is his responsibility to create an ecosystem where students actively participate in the learning process, rather than passively receiving information. The focus is on active learning, where students engage with course materials through case studies, brainstorming sessions, group work, and hands-on activities. Students are encouraged to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and critically analyze information. These methods not only reinforce key concepts but also foster critical thinking, ultimately equipping students to navigate a successful journey in the corporate sector.
