Alumni Connect - NEST - A Unique Alumni Initiative

Alumni Connect - NEST - A Unique Alumni Initiative

UPES is more than just an institution where students spend a few years earning a degree. It’s a place where they form meaningful personal and professional connections that last throughout their lives and careers. Our students – even when they leave our establishment – continue to be a part of our community and they find a haven every time they return to the place that nurtured them and gave them wings to fly.
The UPES Alumni Team proudly supports nearly 22,000 UPES alumni that live and work around the world. Our dedicated staff and alumni volunteers help manage more than 10 UPES Alumni Regional Chapters that meet periodically for various events. We also welcome alumni back to our campus to mentor existing students, and as special guests on advisory boards and other committees.
To further fortify our alumni network, and insulate our alums from the upheavals, disruptions, and evolving business models in a post-Covid world, we have launched NEST – a resource base where alumni can return for advice and support as they progress in their careers.
