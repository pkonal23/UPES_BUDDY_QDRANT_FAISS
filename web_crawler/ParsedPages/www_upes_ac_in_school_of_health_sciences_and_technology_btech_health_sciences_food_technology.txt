Program Details
The B.Tech. Food Technology program offered by UPES provides a comprehensive education in the field of food technology. Students in this undergraduate program will learn about various aspects of the post-harvest technology of edible food crops, including collection, transportation, cleaning, grading, and storage of a wide range of food crops such as cereals, millets, oilseeds, pulses, fruits and vegetables, tubers, milk, and meat. They will also gain knowledge about the processing of raw food materials into processed food products, as well as the nutritional composition, value-added food products, food additives, food packaging, and storage techniques.
The curriculum of the program covers various essential topics, including food industry establishment, equipment, processes, and techniques used in food processing plants. Students will also learn about government rules and regulations, standards, and safety issues related to food. Instrumental analysis, analytical methods, standardization, and calibration of food testing methods and equipment are also part of the program's curriculum. To provide practical exposure, the program offers a two-month industrial training in food industries, along with a two-month social internship. Hands-on training and industrial visits are conducted to enhance practical learning.
A unique feature of the B.Tech. Food Technology program at UPES is the thesis support process. Students receive training in scientific writing, which is followed by six months of research and thesis support. This component allows students to delve deeper into a specific area of food technology, conduct research, and produce a thesis under the guidance and support of faculty members.
