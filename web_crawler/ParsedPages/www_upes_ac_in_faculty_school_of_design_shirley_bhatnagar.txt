Profile Summary
Professor Shirley Bhatnagar, an alumna of the National Institute of Design, specializes in Industrial ceramics. Her work in ceramics and traditional crafts bridges art and design. She received the first international artist's exchange award between Indian Ceramics Triennial and British Ceramics Biennials in 2019, supported by the Charles Wallace Trust in the UK.
With over 20 years of experience, she is a renowned design professional, educator, and artist. Notably, she curates design shows in Delhi and Mumbai with established galleries. Professor Bhatnagar's signature style lies in her anthropomorphic ceramics, reflecting her passion for history and culture. Her unique blend of art and design continues to captivate audiences worldwide.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Prof. Bhatnagar established her studio, Irregular Beauty, specializing in unique handmade products. Her artistic expertise extended to various public and private commissions, enhancing interior spaces across India. As a professor at the Indian Institute of Crafts and Design, Jaipur, she played a pivotal role in curriculum development, managing the ceramics department, and facilitating student placements.
Her professional journey began in 1998 at Good Earth Studio, where she designed tableware and containers for a herbal cosmetic line.
