A future perspective on the sustainable and renewable energy sector
Mansha Dhingra
Published 09/02/2021
In today’s age of energy crisis, a career in sustainable and renewable engineering is a lucrative choice. Energy engineering graduates can explore opportunities to work as solar energy system engineers, project managers, wind farm designers, and more
Engineering is a vast field of study that is going to remain until we cease to exist. Industrial revolution 4.0 has introduced several new technologies (Internet of Things, Machine Learning, and Robotics) that engineers need to imbibe to meet future demands.
Given the new industrial revolution, it is important that we re-look the existing engineering specialisations by introducing some new-age courses that will be relevant in the future years. B.Tech. Advanced Materials and Nano Technology, B.Tech. Medical Devices, and B.Tech. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Engineering are some of the advanced engineering programs.
India is the second-largest populous country and the fastest-growing economy in the world. This has led to increasing demand for energy in India. Due to its dense population, the pollution level in India has also risen. The Indian government is planning to boost the production of renewable energy. Solar energy, wind energy, thermal energy, biomass energy, and tidal energy are important renewable energy resources in India. At present, all the major industries need to monitor energy use. This implies that opportunities for renewable and sustainable energy engineering graduates across all sectors (such as the food industry, pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, medical device, and transport sector) will rise sharply.
The country’s geographical location has the potential to generate solar energy. The government of India and intergovernmental agencies are looking forward to source and supply energy resources to meet the demands of citizens and industry.
A promising future for specialists in B.Tech. in Renewable and Sustainable Energy
Earlier, renewable energy technologies had an environmental niche. But today, the sustainability of renewable energy demonstrates a key economic driver in generating revenue, creating jobs, and stimulating technological developments. Planning, financing, installation, storage, distribution, operation, maintenance, processing, and renewable electricity sales and grid management, opens the door for countless job opportunities.
With the world’s core resources depleting and causing damage to environment and ecosystem, the industry is rapidly moving towards sustainable technology. For instance, energy-saving appliances, electric vehicles, access to solar energy and finding alternatives for plastic usage etc.
According to Dr. Sushabhan Chowdhury, Department of Electrical and Electronics, UPES, “The demand for engineers working in the renewable sector will no doubt increase in the coming years. Engineers are needed to research, design, and construct ways to find new, eco-friendly, and sustainable sources of energy. The renewable and sustainability sector is a great choice for students. UPES is one of the few institutions offering a specialisation in B.Tech. Renewable and Sustainable Energy.”
Graduates in renewable and sustainable energy can work in the following areas:
Process engineering
Design engineering
Research and development
Program engineers
Energy auditors
Civil and construction
Environmental engineers
Transportation engineering
Defence
Energy systems design, conventional and renewable
Energy management and project management
Manufacturing industry, particularly big energy users, such as food, pharmaceuticals, and transport industries
Consultancy

A future perspective on the sustainable and renewable energy sector
Mansha Dhingra
Published 09/02/2021
In today’s age of energy crisis, a career in sustainable and renewable engineering is a lucrative choice. Energy engineering graduates can explore opportunities to work as solar energy system engineers, project managers, wind farm designers, and more
Engineering is a vast field of study that is going to remain until we cease to exist. Industrial revolution 4.0 has introduced several new technologies (Internet of Things, Machine Learning, and Robotics) that engineers need to imbibe to meet future demands.
Given the new industrial revolution, it is important that we re-look the existing engineering specialisations by introducing some new-age courses that will be relevant in the future years. B.Tech. Advanced Materials and Nano Technology, B.Tech. Medical Devices, and B.Tech. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Engineering are some of the advanced engineering programs.
India is the second-largest populous country and the fastest-growing economy in the world. This has led to increasing demand for energy in India. Due to its dense population, the pollution level in India has also risen. The Indian government is planning to boost the production of renewable energy. Solar energy, wind energy, thermal energy, biomass energy, and tidal energy are important renewable energy resources in India. At present, all the major industries need to monitor energy use. This implies that opportunities for renewable and sustainable energy engineering graduates across all sectors (such as the food industry, pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, medical device, and transport sector) will rise sharply.
The country’s geographical location has the potential to generate solar energy. The government of India and intergovernmental agencies are looking forward to source and supply energy resources to meet the demands of citizens and industry.
A promising future for specialists in B.Tech. in Renewable and Sustainable Energy
Earlier, renewable energy technologies had an environmental niche. But today, the sustainability of renewable energy demonstrates a key economic driver in generating revenue, creating jobs, and stimulating technological developments. Planning, financing, installation, storage, distribution, operation, maintenance, processing, and renewable electricity sales and grid management, opens the door for countless job opportunities.
With the world’s core resources depleting and causing damage to environment and ecosystem, the industry is rapidly moving towards sustainable technology. For instance, energy-saving appliances, electric vehicles, access to solar energy and finding alternatives for plastic usage etc.
According to Dr. Sushabhan Chowdhury, Department of Electrical and Electronics, UPES, “The demand for engineers working in the renewable sector will no doubt increase in the coming years. Engineers are needed to research, design, and construct ways to find new, eco-friendly, and sustainable sources of energy. The renewable and sustainability sector is a great choice for students. UPES is one of the few institutions offering a specialisation in B.Tech. Renewable and Sustainable Energy.”
Graduates in renewable and sustainable energy can work in the following areas:
Process engineering
Design engineering
Research and development
Program engineers
Energy auditors
Civil and construction
Environmental engineers
Transportation engineering
Defence
Energy systems design, conventional and renewable
Energy management and project management
Manufacturing industry, particularly big energy users, such as food, pharmaceuticals, and transport industries
Consultancy
Why UPES School of Engineering?
