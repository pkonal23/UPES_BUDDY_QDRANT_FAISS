Program Details
The
B. Sc. in Physics
program offered by UPES School of Advanced Engineering is an exciting 3-year Applied Science Cluster program with multiple entry and exit options. Following the guidelines of the NEP 2020 framework, the curriculum empowers students to personalize their education according to their unique interests and career aspirations. The program spans 8 semesters, with each semester consisting of courses totaling a maximum of 20 credits. Depending on the number of credits earned, students have the flexibility to exit the program at different stages with varying qualifications. After accumulating 40 credits in a year, students can receive a certificate in the relevant discipline. Earning 80 credits in two years qualifies them for a diploma, while achieving 120 credits in three years enables them to obtain a full-fledged undergraduate degree.
In the fourth and final year, students are presented with two distinct options. If they choose to undertake a set of advanced domain-specific courses, they will be awarded a B. Sc. degree. On the other hand, for those inclined towards research, pursuing extensive research and defending their thesis in front of a panel of experts from their area of research will lead to the prestigious B. Sc. designation. The program also offers elective specializations in Astronomy & Astrophysics, Computational Physics, and Materials Science & Nanotechnology, allowing students to delve deeper into their preferred areas of study. Furthermore, the fourth year of the program focuses on research-specific courses, providing essential skills and knowledge for successful completion of students' dissertations.
An attractive feature of the program is the provision for lateral entry, in line with the NEP 2020 regulations, enabling students to join at advanced stages based on their prior qualifications and experiences. Upon completion of the
B. Sc. in Physics
, students have the opportunity to directly pursue a Ph.D. with coursework, both within India and abroad, further enhancing their academic and research prospects. Overall, this comprehensive program fosters academic flexibility, research opportunities, and specialized knowledge in the field of Physics, making it an excellent choice for students aspiring to pursue advanced studies or research careers in the discipline.

Program Details
The
B. Sc. in Physics
program offered by UPES School of Advanced Engineering is an exciting 3-year Applied Science Cluster program with multiple entry and exit options. Following the guidelines of the NEP 2020 framework, the curriculum empowers students to personalize their education according to their unique interests and career aspirations. The program spans 8 semesters, with each semester consisting of courses totaling a maximum of 20 credits. Depending on the number of credits earned, students have the flexibility to exit the program at different stages with varying qualifications. After accumulating 40 credits in a year, students can receive a certificate in the relevant discipline. Earning 80 credits in two years qualifies them for a diploma, while achieving 120 credits in three years enables them to obtain a full-fledged undergraduate degree.
In the fourth and final year, students are presented with two distinct options. If they choose to undertake a set of advanced domain-specific courses, they will be awarded a B. Sc. degree. On the other hand, for those inclined towards research, pursuing extensive research and defending their thesis in front of a panel of experts from their area of research will lead to the prestigious B. Sc. designation. The program also offers elective specializations in Astronomy & Astrophysics, Computational Physics, and Materials Science & Nanotechnology, allowing students to delve deeper into their preferred areas of study. Furthermore, the fourth year of the program focuses on research-specific courses, providing essential skills and knowledge for successful completion of students' dissertations.
An attractive feature of the program is the provision for lateral entry, in line with the NEP 2020 regulations, enabling students to join at advanced stages based on their prior qualifications and experiences. Upon completion of the
B. Sc. in Physics
, students have the opportunity to directly pursue a Ph.D. with coursework, both within India and abroad, further enhancing their academic and research prospects. Overall, this comprehensive program fosters academic flexibility, research opportunities, and specialized knowledge in the field of Physics, making it an excellent choice for students aspiring to pursue advanced studies or research careers in the discipline.

Program Details
The
B. Sc. in Physics
program offered by UPES School of Advanced Engineering is an exciting 3-year Applied Science Cluster program with multiple entry and exit options. Following the guidelines of the NEP 2020 framework, the curriculum empowers students to personalize their education according to their unique interests and career aspirations. The program spans 8 semesters, with each semester consisting of courses totaling a maximum of 20 credits. Depending on the number of credits earned, students have the flexibility to exit the program at different stages with varying qualifications. After accumulating 40 credits in a year, students can receive a certificate in the relevant discipline. Earning 80 credits in two years qualifies them for a diploma, while achieving 120 credits in three years enables them to obtain a full-fledged undergraduate degree.
In the fourth and final year, students are presented with two distinct options. If they choose to undertake a set of advanced domain-specific courses, they will be awarded a B. Sc. degree. On the other hand, for those inclined towards research, pursuing extensive research and defending their thesis in front of a panel of experts from their area of research will lead to the prestigious B. Sc. designation. The program also offers elective specializations in Astronomy & Astrophysics, Computational Physics, and Materials Science & Nanotechnology, allowing students to delve deeper into their preferred areas of study. Furthermore, the fourth year of the program focuses on research-specific courses, providing essential skills and knowledge for successful completion of students' dissertations.
An attractive feature of the program is the provision for lateral entry, in line with the NEP 2020 regulations, enabling students to join at advanced stages based on their prior qualifications and experiences. Upon completion of the
B. Sc. in Physics
, students have the opportunity to directly pursue a Ph.D. with coursework, both within India and abroad, further enhancing their academic and research prospects.
