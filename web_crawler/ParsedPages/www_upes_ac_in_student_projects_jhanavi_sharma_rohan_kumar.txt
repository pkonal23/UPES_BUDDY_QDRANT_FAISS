COVAT study to the serological response of the Indian cohort in Uttarakhand

COVAT study to the serological response of the Indian cohort in Uttarakhand

Jhanavi Sharma, Rohan Kumar, students pursuing the degree of MSc. In Microbiology &, Integrated- BSc-MSc during their tenure in 2021 conducted their project on a cross-sectional coronavirus vaccine-induced antibody test (COVAT study) to the serological response of the Indian cohort in Uttarakhand
A COVID-19 serosurvey jointly funded by Genotypic Technology pvt limited and UPES R&D was conducted on May 3 and 4, 2023, at UPES campus to ensure that vaccines have effectively produced antibodies in the subjects. India was recording thousands of cases, and awareness of whether the vaccine had induced an antibody response would have made people decide whether to go for a booster. The vaccines are ineffective against all isolates, but they help reduce the viral load and severity of the disease.
The project was conducted by a serosurvey funded by Genotypic technology pvt. Ltd.
