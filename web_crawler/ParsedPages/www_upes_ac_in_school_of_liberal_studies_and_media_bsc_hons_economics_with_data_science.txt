Program Details
Economics pervades every aspect of our life be it making decisions on the amount of tax a polluting firm must pay or maximizing the welfare of society. The Economics and Data Science program at UPES embodies transdisciplinary learning and experiential pedagogy. We use real-life examples to bring the classroom to life. For example, students are asked to investigate how rents change because of distance from the university. In a world increasingly driven by data subjects like microeconomics, data science gives our students the edge to address the world’s pressing concerns.
Transdisciplinary Learning
Economics delves into every aspect of our life, be it behaviour, sustainability or development, hence we provide students with a wide variety of courses to choose from. From courses such as Environmental Economics and Development Economics to Experimental Economics, students are free to choose according to their interests. Additionally, our faculty is also involved in transdisciplinary research. For example, our faculty are involved in research in the economics of waste, designing interventions to promote pro-environment behaviour which combines psychology and economics. Such on-site experiences of faculty keep the students abreast with the latest research and innovations in the field.
Experiential Pedagogy
We believe that students understand better when they apply the concepts in real life. Each course in our programme engages students actively. For instance, students are engaged in paper presentations which takes learning beyond books. Additionally, students also work closely on their projects/ research papers with faculty members which helps foster analytical skills, essential for working with data. For instance, students use real-world data ranging from tourism, markets, and crime for their term papers.
Global Exposure
Lectures by distinguished experts, international student exchange and global collaborative research, is a hallmarks of our programme. These collaborations provide a platform for students to share and gain experiences. Our faculty members have international grants and collaborators who bring their global experience to the classroom. Our international collaborations provide a platform for students to immerse themselves in research with foreign collaborators.
Faculty from Renowned Institutions
Our faculty members hail from prestigious universities like Cornell University, Delhi University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and Visva-Bharati (Central) University bringing a wealth of expertise and insights to the classroom. Their guidance empowers students to delve into cutting-edge research and innovative practices. In essence, the Economics with Data Science programme blends academic rigour with hands-on data analysis.
Program Highlights
Emphasis on quantitative and empirics-based practice, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge in real-life situations.
Transdisciplinary learning environment with exposure to learners from six UPES schools viz. Engineering, Computer Science, Law, Management, Design and Health Sciences.
Access to globally renowned academicians, researchers, and thinkers from marquee institutions such as Cambridge, Cornell, Imperial College, and NUS Singapore enabling exposure to innovative knowledge and perspectives in the field.
Opportunities for developing applied skills through firsthand learning experiences in the form of internships, fellowships, research seminars and, masterclasses.
Career Opportunities
With their expertise in Economics with Data Science, students will be ably skilled to inform
policy decisions, drive meaningful change in the global economic landscape and enable data-driven decision-making across industries.
Graduates who hold a B.Sc. in Economics with a Data Science degree could pursue the following roles:
Research Analyst
Industry Analyst
Data Analyst/Scientist
Market Research Analyst
Policy analyst at thinktanks and consulting firms
Students may also pursue advanced degrees in Economics or Data Science and work towards a career in Academics, Public Services, or Policymaking in the Government and NGO sectors.

Program Details
Economics pervades every aspect of our life be it making decisions on the amount of tax a polluting firm must pay or maximizing the welfare of society. The Economics and Data Science program at UPES embodies transdisciplinary learning and experiential pedagogy. We use real-life examples to bring the classroom to life. For example, students are asked to investigate how rents change because of distance from the university. In a world increasingly driven by data subjects like microeconomics, data science gives our students the edge to address the world’s pressing concerns.
Transdisciplinary Learning
Economics delves into every aspect of our life, be it behaviour, sustainability or development, hence we provide students with a wide variety of courses to choose from. From courses such as Environmental Economics and Development Economics to Experimental Economics, students are free to choose according to their interests. Additionally, our faculty is also involved in transdisciplinary research. For example, our faculty are involved in research in the economics of waste, designing interventions to promote pro-environment behaviour which combines psychology and economics. Such on-site experiences of faculty keep the students abreast with the latest research and innovations in the field.
Experiential Pedagogy
We believe that students understand better when they apply the concepts in real life. Each course in our programme engages students actively. For instance, students are engaged in paper presentations which takes learning beyond books. Additionally, students also work closely on their projects/ research papers with faculty members which helps foster analytical skills, essential for working with data. For instance, students use real-world data ranging from tourism, markets, and crime for their term papers.
Global Exposure
Lectures by distinguished experts, international student exchange and global collaborative research, is a hallmarks of our programme. These collaborations provide a platform for students to share and gain experiences. Our faculty members have international grants and collaborators who bring their global experience to the classroom. Our international collaborations provide a platform for students to immerse themselves in research with foreign collaborators.
Faculty from Renowned Institutions
Our faculty members hail from prestigious universities like Cornell University, Delhi University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and Visva-Bharati (Central) University bringing a wealth of expertise and insights to the classroom. Their guidance empowers students to delve into cutting-edge research and innovative practices. In essence, the Economics with Data Science programme blends academic rigour with hands-on data analysis.
Program Highlights
Emphasis on quantitative and empirics-based practice, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge in real-life situations.
Transdisciplinary learning environment with exposure to learners from six UPES schools viz. Engineering, Computer Science, Law, Management, Design and Health Sciences.
Access to globally renowned academicians, researchers, and thinkers from marquee institutions such as Cambridge, Cornell, Imperial College, and NUS Singapore enabling exposure to innovative knowledge and perspectives in the field.
Opportunities for developing applied skills through firsthand learning experiences in the form of internships, fellowships, research seminars and, masterclasses.
Career Opportunities
With their expertise in Economics with Data Science, students will be ably skilled to inform
policy decisions, drive meaningful change in the global economic landscape and enable data-driven decision-making across industries.
Graduates who hold a B.Sc. in Economics with a Data Science degree could pursue the following roles:
Research Analyst
Industry Analyst
Data Analyst/Scientist
Market Research Analyst
Policy analyst at thinktanks and consulting firms
Students may also pursue advanced degrees in Economics or Data Science and work towards a career in Academics, Public Services, or Policymaking in the Government and NGO sectors.

Our faculty members hail from prestigious universities like Cornell University, Delhi University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and Visva-Bharati (Central) University bringing a wealth of expertise and insights to the classroom. Their guidance empowers students to delve into cutting-edge research and innovative practices. In essence, the Economics with Data Science programme blends academic rigour with hands-on data analysis.

Economics pervades every aspect of our life be it making decisions on the amount of tax a polluting firm must pay or maximizing the welfare of society. The Economics and Data Science program at UPES embodies transdisciplinary learning and experiential pedagogy. We use real-life examples to bring the classroom to life. For example, students are asked to investigate how rents change because of distance from the university. In a world increasingly driven by data subjects like microeconomics, data science gives our students the edge to address the world’s pressing concerns.

Transdisciplinary Learning
Economics delves into every aspect of our life, be it behaviour, sustainability or development, hence we provide students with a wide variety of courses to choose from. From courses such as Environmental Economics and Development Economics to Experimental Economics, students are free to choose according to their interests. Additionally, our faculty is also involved in transdisciplinary research. For example, our faculty are involved in research in the economics of waste, designing interventions to promote pro-environment behaviour which combines psychology and economics. Such on-site experiences of faculty keep the students abreast with the latest research and innovations in the field.

Experiential Pedagogy
We believe that students understand better when they apply the concepts in real life. Each course in our programme engages students actively. For instance, students are engaged in paper presentations which takes learning beyond books. Additionally, students also work closely on their projects/ research papers with faculty members which helps foster analytical skills, essential for working with data. For instance, students use real-world data ranging from tourism, markets, and crime for their term papers.

Global Exposure
Lectures by distinguished experts, international student exchange and global collaborative research, is a hallmarks of our programme. These collaborations provide a platform for students to share and gain experiences. Our faculty members have international grants and collaborators who bring their global experience to the classroom. Our international collaborations provide a platform for students to immerse themselves in research with foreign collaborators.
