Teaching Philosophy
Ms. Bahuguna’s teaching pedagogy combines dynamic teaching methods, learning activities, and critical assessments. She also believes in critically assessing her pedagogy through the lens of students’ experiences. She visualizes that teaching and assessing are two related practices as a cycle because they are iterative and ongoing. She also diversifies her pedagogy by committing her students to discipline. She is a fierce advocate of active learning and less traditional lecturing, which comprises conducting discussions and quizzes, team-based learning, experiential learning, problem-based learning, and case-based learning that can develop critical thinking and problem-solving attitude in students. She also makes sure that in her lecture, students do not underestimate themselves, so she creates an environment that normalizes mistakes as part of the learning process. She emphasizes the importance of hands-on learning in pharmacy, hence encouraging students to actively participate in laboratory exercises.
