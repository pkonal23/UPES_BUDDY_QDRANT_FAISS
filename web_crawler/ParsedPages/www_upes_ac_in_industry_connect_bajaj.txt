UPES Partners with Bajaj Auto Ltd. to Launch BEST – Bajaj Engineering Skills Training Program, a company with a legacy of giving back to society, to launch a flagship CSR initiative aimed at upskilling underprivileged engineering graduates from tier 2 and tier 3 cities.

Support for Economically Weaker Sections:
BEST is dedicated to empowering youth from backward and disadvantaged areas, ensuring they have access to scholarships and resources to achieve their career goals.
Practical Exposure:
Students will gain hands-on experience in emerging technology spaces, preparing them to thrive in current and future job markets.
This partnership underscores Bajaj Auto Ltd.'s commitment to societal upliftment and UPES's dedication to bridging the gap between academic learning and industry needs, paving the way for an inclusive and skilled workforce.
