Dr. Ritesh Dubey

Assistant Professor-SG

Profile Summary
Dr. Dubey is a renowned subject expert in Crystal Engineering, Self-assembly and Supramolecular Chemistry. He is a prominent structural scientist with extensive research experience in various aspects of chemistry and material sciences. His academic journey includes obtaining a PhD from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, followed by nearly 7 years of research experience at top-ranked institutions worldwide. Throughout his academic career, Dr. Dubey has published numerous articles in high-quality, peer-reviewed scientific journals, such as J. Am. Chem. Soc. (ACS Publications, USA), Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. (Wiley Publications, Germany), IUCrJ (IUCr Publications, UK), and Chem. Commun. (RSC Publications, UK).
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Dr. Dubey was associated with the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), Hyderabad. He also served as a postdoctoral scientist at the Department of Applied Chemistry, School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Japan, where he contributed to one of Japan's National Projects called ACCEL. Additionally, he worked as a researcher at IISc Bangalore and IIT Kanpur.
Research Interests
Dr. Dubey's research interests encompass Self-assemblies, Crystallization, Non-covalent interactions, Programmed solids, Molecular materials, Crystalline materials, and Molecular aggregation.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Dubey employs fundamental tools with ingenuity and passion to create valuable assets. Beyond sharing knowledge, he believes in inspiring creativity, nurturing curiosity, fostering critical thinking, and preparing students for the challenges of the complex world they will encounter beyond the campus.
Courses Taught
Dr. Dubey has taught various courses, including Contemporary Research, Challenges, and Trends (PhD; School of Engineering, >100 scholars), Pesticide Chemistry (B.Sc), and s&p-Block Elements, States of Matter, and Chemical Kinetics (B.Sc).
Awards and Grants
In recognition of his pursuit of research excellence, Dr. Dubey has received the Toulouse Medal (IISc Bangalore) and the Carl Storm International Diversity Fellowship (GRC USA).
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Dubey played a vital role as a member of an international team in one of Japan's National Projects, aiming to develop a newer and more effective method for characterizing complex analytes in microgram quantities. This revolutionary method has proven highly valuable in chemical-based industries, providing opportunities to explore uncharted chemical space that was previously inaccessible due to limited analytical tools in academic and industrial research. Additionally, Dr. Dubey actively contributes as a scientific reviewer for peer-reviewed international journals, such as Crystal Growth & Design (ACS Publications), CrystEngComm (RSC Publications), and Polyhedron (Elsevier Publications).

Scholarly Activities
Dr. Dubey played a vital role as a member of an international team in one of Japan's National Projects, aiming to develop a newer and more effective method for characterizing complex analytes in microgram quantities. This revolutionary method has proven highly valuable in chemical-based industries, providing opportunities to explore uncharted chemical space that was previously inaccessible due to limited analytical tools in academic and industrial research. Additionally, Dr. Dubey actively contributes as a scientific reviewer for peer-reviewed international journals, such as Crystal Growth & Design (ACS Publications), CrystEngComm (RSC Publications), and Polyhedron (Elsevier Publications).
