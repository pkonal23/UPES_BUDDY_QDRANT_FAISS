National Service Scheme
The National Service Scheme (NSS) has been in operation in UPES since April 2018. The fundamental objective of the NSS is to awaken and enrich the social consciousness of students. The scheme provides an opportunity for students to engage in constructive social action, programs, develop co-operative team spirit and gain skills in democratic leadership quality.
Student of UPES are the primary beneficiary of the program by way of development of their perception about the community, their skill in performing specific jobs, and in developing the qualities of a leader, an organizer, and an administrator and the overall development of their personality as a whole. Through NSS, they get opportunities to see the community closely and thus get an experience of human nature in relation to their environment.
