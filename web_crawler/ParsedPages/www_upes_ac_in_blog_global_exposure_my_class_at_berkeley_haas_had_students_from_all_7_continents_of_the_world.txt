My class at Berkeley Haas had students from all 7 continents of the world
Syed Mohd Raza Taqvi
Published 22/05/2023
Some highlights of my journey at Berkeley Haas Global Access Program and the transformative impact it has had on my personal and professional growth
It has been an incredible journey so far, pursuing my MBA in Oil and Gas Management at UPES Dehradun. Thanks to the university’s Study Abroad program, I lived my dream at UC Berkeley, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world. Berkeley Haas Global Access Program (BHGAP) has opened doors to an immersive learning experience, exposing me to diverse cultures, groundbreaking ideas, and a global network of students. I spent a whole semester approximating 6 months, studying BHGAP in Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
A Classroom of Global Perspectives
One of the most remarkable aspects of my MBA program at Berkeley Haas was the incredible diversity within our class. Representing all seven continents of the world, my classmates brought unique perspectives, experiences, and insights from their respective regions. The exposure to such diverse backgrounds expanded my understanding of global business and broadened my horizons. Collaborating with individuals from different cultures not only enriched our classroom discussions but also fostered a deeper appreciation for the global interconnectedness of our world.
Exploring Prominent Companies
Berkeley Haas takes pride in providing its students with unparalleled exposure to industry leaders. Through company site visits, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the operations of esteemed organizations such as Accenture, Amazon Web Services, Orange Silicon Valley, Apple, and Google. These visits offered a valuable glimpse into the inner workings of successful enterprises and provided insights into their innovative approaches to business. Witnessing the convergence of theory and practice has been truly enlightening, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from the best in the industry.
Experiencing the Berkeley-Stanford Face-Off
Witnessing the Berkeley vs Stanford Football Game at the Berkeley Stadium was an unforgettable experience. The competitiveness between these two world-class institutions was palpable, as passionate fans cheered on their respective teams. The electric atmosphere showcased the immense school spirit and pride that runs deep within the Berkeley community. It was a moment that brought us all together, fostering a sense of unity and camaraderie among the students, faculty, and alumni.
Networking and Cultural Exchange
The global exposure I gained at Berkeley Haas went far beyond the confines of the classroom. Networking events and social gatherings provided ample opportunities to connect with students from diverse backgrounds. Engaging in meaningful conversations, sharing experiences, and exchanging ideas with individuals from different continents has been immensely enriching. These interactions not only enhanced my cultural competence but also broadened my perspective on various global issues. The bonds formed during my time at Berkeley Haas will undoubtedly continue to shape my personal and professional life long after graduation.
Leadership and Personal Growth
Being part of the Student Advisory Board at Berkeley Haas has been a rewarding experience. As a volunteer-based association, it allowed me to exercise my leadership, event planning, management, and advocacy skills. Collaborating with like-minded individuals, I actively contributed to the betterment of the student community. The opportunity to shape initiatives and drive positive change has been instrumental in my personal growth and development as a leader. I am grateful for the platform Berkeley Haas provided me to make a difference.
Gratitude to UPES
As I reflect upon my MBA journey at Berkeley Haas, I cannot help but express my gratitude to UPES for making this life-changing experience possible. The university’s Study Abroad program paved the way for my enrollment at UC Berkeley, providing me with the tools and knowledge to thrive in a global business environment. The exceptional infrastructure at Berkeley, including state-of-the-art facilities such as the swimming pool, gym, and sports facilities, further enhanced my overall experience.
Conclusion
My MBA experience at Berkeley Haas has been nothing short of transformative. From engaging in intellectually stimulating classes to exploring the operations of leading companies, and from experiencing the thrill of a Berkeley-Stanford face-off to forging connections with students from all corners of the globe, every moment has contributed to my personal and professional growth. This journey has opened doors to new opportunities, expanded my cultural competence, and equipped me with the skills needed to thrive in a globalized world. I will forever cherish the memories and friendships formed during my time at Berkeley Haas, and I am confident that the lessons learned here will propel me towards a successful future.

Some highlights of my journey at Berkeley Haas Global Access Program and the transformative impact it has had on my personal and professional growth
It has been an incredible journey so far, pursuing my MBA in Oil and Gas Management at UPES Dehradun. Thanks to the university’s Study Abroad program, I lived my dream at UC Berkeley, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world. Berkeley Haas Global Access Program (BHGAP) has opened doors to an immersive learning experience, exposing me to diverse cultures, groundbreaking ideas, and a global network of students. I spent a whole semester approximating 6 months, studying BHGAP in Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
A Classroom of Global Perspectives
One of the most remarkable aspects of my MBA program at Berkeley Haas was the incredible diversity within our class. Representing all seven continents of the world, my classmates brought unique perspectives, experiences, and insights from their respective regions. The exposure to such diverse backgrounds expanded my understanding of global business and broadened my horizons. Collaborating with individuals from different cultures not only enriched our classroom discussions but also fostered a deeper appreciation for the global interconnectedness of our world.
Exploring Prominent Companies
Berkeley Haas takes pride in providing its students with unparalleled exposure to industry leaders. Through company site visits, I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the operations of esteemed organizations such as Accenture, Amazon Web Services, Orange Silicon Valley, Apple, and Google. These visits offered a valuable glimpse into the inner workings of successful enterprises and provided insights into their innovative approaches to business. Witnessing the convergence of theory and practice has been truly enlightening, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from the best in the industry.
Experiencing the Berkeley-Stanford Face-Off
Witnessing the Berkeley vs Stanford Football Game at the Berkeley Stadium was an unforgettable experience. The competitiveness between these two world-class institutions was palpable, as passionate fans cheered on their respective teams. The electric atmosphere showcased the immense school spirit and pride that runs deep within the Berkeley community. It was a moment that brought us all together, fostering a sense of unity and camaraderie among the students, faculty, and alumni.

The global exposure I gained at Berkeley Haas went far beyond the confines of the classroom. Networking events and social gatherings provided ample opportunities to connect with students from diverse backgrounds.
