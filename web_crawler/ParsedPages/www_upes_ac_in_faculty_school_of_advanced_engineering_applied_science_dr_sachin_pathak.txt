Dr. Sachin Pathak

Dr. Sachin Pathak

Profile Summary
Dr. Sachin Pathak holds a Ph.D. in Physics from IIT Delhi and possesses extensive knowledge and experience in the domains of physics and materials science. His primary area of interest lies in spintronics, where he has made significant contributions through his research on advanced magnetic materials. Dr. Pathak's work revolves around understanding spin-dependent phenomena, such as spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT), in spintronic devices. He has been honoured with several prestigious fellowships and awards in recognition of his outstanding academic achievements and published works. These include the CSIR Research Fellowship at IIT Delhi, the BK Plus Fellowship, and the Yonsei Postdoctoral Fellowship. Dr. Pathak actively engages in research collaborations both nationally and internationally, fostering cross-disciplinary dialogue and driving developments in spintronics. He has published approximately 34 research articles in reputed SCI-indexed journals and holds 2 patents. His unwavering dedication to scientific investigation, combined with his commitment to education and mentoring, has established him as a rising researcher and a prominent member of the scientific community.
Work Experience
Dr. Pathak pursued his Ph.D. in Physics with a focus on nanomagnetic materials at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi), New Delhi, India. Following the completion of his doctorate, he spent three years as a Researcher at Yonsei University (QS world ranking 73), where he contributed to the advancement of magnetic memory technology, a crucial area for data storage and information processing. He later served as a Research Professor at Korea University (QS world ranking 74), Seoul, South Korea, for three years. In 2020, Dr. Pathak joined the esteemed faculty at the Department of Physics, UPES Dehradun in India. Since then, he has been actively involved in teaching and mentoring students, guiding them in their pursuit of knowledge and excellence in materials science.
Research Interests
The primary focus of Dr. Pathak's research has been on the investigation and development of nano-sized ultra-thin magnetic and spin systems. These nano-sized ultra-thin magnetic and spin systems include magnetic superlattices, MTJs, and ferromagnetic nanomaterials. In 2017, he made a significant contribution to developing high-density patterns by ion-induced phase transformation. Using low-energy proton irradiation and non-destructive interface control, he showed that magnetic patterns with a pattern size of ~8 nm may be generated in complex magnetic nanostructures (Applied Physics Letters, 111, 152401). His recent article (Advanced Science, 9, 2201749 (2022)) shows the unique pseudomorph interfacial structure of Co/Pd constructed by phase‐transformation of paramagnetic Co3O4/Pd to ferromagnetic Co/Pd superlattices by low‐energy proton irradiation making it possible to induce extraordinarily large orbital anisotropy and strongly enhance spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the interface, which can be attributed to the strong level of structural inversion asymmetry (SIA) and the substantial in-plane tensile stress built up at the interface between Co and Pd. He also proposed a quick, affordable, and reliable in-house method based on micromagnetic modelling to estimate the characteristics of MTJs in 2017 (Applied Physics Letters, 110, 232401) and 2020 (Nature Scientific Reports, 10, 2799) in response to the challenges of tunnel junction fabrication. He has all-around expertise in growth, characterization of magnetic thin films, and nanostructure along with transport measurements. His capability to develop and measure scientific instruments such as the MOKE microscope/magnetometer (Journal of Applied Physics 115, 043906 (2014)) make him an asset to the organization.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Pathak places a strong emphasis on nurturing student curiosity and critical thinking to inspire a passion for learning physics and materials science. He is dedicated to creating an open and friendly classroom environment that welcomes all students and encourages learning through discussions and exploration. By incorporating relevant real-world examples and interdisciplinary connections, he aims to instill in his students a lifelong interest in the subject matter and equip them with problem-solving abilities crucial for success in higher education and the workforce. Through personalized instruction and continuous feedback, Dr. Pathak hopes his students will become self-directed learners and enthusiastic explorers of the fascinating fields of physics and materials science.
Courses Taught
Dr. Pathak is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable lecturer on various topics in engineering physics, quantum mechanics, and magnetic materials. He combines theoretical frameworks, practical demonstrations, and cutting-edge research to provide students with in-depth knowledge and create engaging learning environments. He aims to equip his students with advanced ideas and critical analysis skills, fostering a genuine interest in physics and materials science.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Pathak has received numerous honours and fellowships, including the CSIR Research Fellowship at IIT Delhi for his Ph.D. work and the BK Plus and Yonsei postdoctoral fellowships. He has also secured funds from various sources, including UGC-DAE-CSR, DESY Germany, and Elettra Italy, to support his research, travel, and collaboration efforts.
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Pathak has published numerous articles in prestigious national and international journals and has actively participated in national and international scientific collaborations in the field of spintronics. Through these collaborations, he shares knowledge, resources, and experiences with esteemed researchers, contributing to the advancement of spintronics research and exploring new phenomena and applications in memory technology.

Research Interests
The primary focus of Dr. Pathak's research has been on the investigation and development of nano-sized ultra-thin magnetic and spin systems. These nano-sized ultra-thin magnetic and spin systems include magnetic superlattices, MTJs, and ferromagnetic nanomaterials. In 2017, he made a significant contribution to developing high-density patterns by ion-induced phase transformation. Using low-energy proton irradiation and non-destructive interface control, he showed that magnetic patterns with a pattern size of ~8 nm may be generated in complex magnetic nanostructures (Applied Physics Letters, 111, 152401). His recent article (Advanced Science, 9, 2201749 (2022)) shows the unique pseudomorph interfacial structure of Co/Pd constructed by phase‐transformation of paramagnetic Co3O4/Pd to ferromagnetic Co/Pd superlattices by low‐energy proton irradiation making it possible to induce extraordinarily large orbital anisotropy and strongly enhance spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the interface, which can be attributed to the strong level of structural inversion asymmetry (SIA) and the substantial in-plane tensile stress built up at the interface between Co and Pd. He also proposed a quick, affordable, and reliable in-house method based on micromagnetic modelling to estimate the characteristics of MTJs in 2017 (Applied Physics Letters, 110, 232401) and 2020 (Nature Scientific Reports, 10, 2799) in response to the challenges of tunnel junction fabrication. He has all-around expertise in growth, characterization of magnetic thin films, and nanostructure along with transport measurements. His capability to develop and measure scientific instruments such as the MOKE microscope/magnetometer (Journal of Applied Physics 115, 043906 (2014)) make him an asset to the organization.
