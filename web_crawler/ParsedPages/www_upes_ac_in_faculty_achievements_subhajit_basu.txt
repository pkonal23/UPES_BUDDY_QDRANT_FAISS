Subhajit Basu - Achievement

Subhajit Basu published in NatureComms as part of an interesting study led by Maritvanerk oliviammetcalf from Microsensor research group, Max Planck Institute of Marine Microbiology, Bremen: “Reactive oxygen species affect the potential for mineralization processes in permeable intertidal flats.”
The study highlights the profound impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as #H2O2, and transient oxygenation on the carbon and Fe/S biogeochemistry in permeable intertidal sediments of the Wadden Sea. ROS plays a crucial role in influencing the rates of aerobic respiration, sulfate reduction, and hydrogen accumulation, consequently regulating the microbial mineralization processes.
