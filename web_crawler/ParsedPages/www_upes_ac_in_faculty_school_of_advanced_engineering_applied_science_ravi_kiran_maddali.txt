Ravi Kiran Maddali

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Ravi Kiran Maddali is an Applied Mathematician with over 20 years of teaching experience. He has an extensive background in instructing postgraduate and undergraduate mathematics courses within both science and engineering streams. His research is primarily focused on applying dynamical systems to real-world problems, particularly exploring interactions among populations in their natural habitats. Notably, Ravi Kiran Maddali possesses significant expertise in technical computing using MATLAB software.
Work Experience
Prior to joining UPES, Ravi Kiran Maddali served as a Mathematics lecturer at Govt. College (Autonomous), Rajahmundry, and JNTU Hyderabad. He has actively contributed as a resource person for the 'Numerical methods and optimization techniques' course of the program 'Advanced Course in Bioinformatics,' jointly organized by JNTU, CDAC, and IICT, Hyderabad. Furthermore, he has been involved in teaching Mathematics courses for industry professionals from Mahindra & Mahindra and Hero MotoCorp during their academic enhancement programs with UPES. Beyond teaching, Ravi Kiran Maddali has taken on various additional responsibilities, including course coordination, student counselling, curriculum design, cluster event coordination, admission processes, internship and placement coordination, lab administration, workload management, accreditation & ranking, and cross-cluster auditing.
Research Interests
Prof. Maddali's research interests encompass Mathematical Modeling & Simulation, Mathematical Biology, Numerical Computing, and Data Science.
Teaching Philosophy
In terms of teaching philosophy, Prof. Maddali strongly believes in fostering a collaborative and student-centred environment to enhance students' reasoning and understanding abilities. His lectures are designed to augment students' skill sets, encouraging the correct usage of mathematical terminology to communicate real-world situations in mathematical expressions and vice versa. Prof. Maddali employs a well-defined mathematical modelling approach in problem-solving techniques, emphasizing formulation, conjecture, solution, and practical interpretation of results. He assigns application-based tasks that prompt students to develop computer programs using software like MATLAB for complex calculations and improved visualizations.
Courses Taught
Prof. Maddali is proficient in teaching a diverse range of courses across various schools of the university. These include Engineering Mathematics, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Complex Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Graph Theory, Linear Algebra, Integral Transforms, Operations Research, Optimization Techniques, Business Mathematics, Statistical Techniques, Remedial Mathematics, Programming in MATLAB, Theory of Computation, and more.
Scholarly Activities
Driven by a passion for research, Prof. Maddali actively pursues scholarly work in the areas of mathematical modeling, publishing his findings in peer-reviewed journals. He consistently upgrades his technical skills by participating in various Faculty Development Programs (FDPs), workshops, and conferences. Ravi Kiran Maddali is highly motivated to enhance students' skills through training programs and has successfully designed a course on "MATLAB Programming for Engineers," benefiting around 600 students who have applied the software in their projects, dissertations, and research. Additionally, he holds professional memberships for various scientific organizations such as the Systems Society of India, ISIAM, and IAENG Societies of Scientific Computing, Operations Research, and Artificial Intelligence.
