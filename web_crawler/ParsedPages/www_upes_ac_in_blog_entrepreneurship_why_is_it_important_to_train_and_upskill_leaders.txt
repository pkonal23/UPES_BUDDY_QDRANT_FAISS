Why is it Important to Train and Upskill Leaders?
Prof. Rahul Nainwal
Published 10/11/2023
Post-pandemic, there has been a major shift in the way businesses function. While the stage for business disruption was long set by technological advancements such as AI, automation, and big data analytics, the pandemic acted as a burning matchstick on a pile of fireworks. Overnight,  businesses had to transition to remote work, necessitating the adoption of real-time digital systems to ensure continued productivity. For leaders, this new business landscape brought forth fresh challenges.  The rapidly changing market dynamics coupled with technological advancements compelled businesses to focus on upskilling their employees and management to navigate a complex landscape to stay ahead of the competition.
Businesses must develop leadership talent within their organisations who can translate the company’s vision into action from a strategic point of view. To be impactful in leading their companies in the new world of business, leaders require a specific blend of skills and attributes. Leaders must embrace constant learning while keeping an eye on the future. By upskilling themselves, leaders can anticipate changes and adapt quickly, thereby staying ahead of the competition. This is crucial as training and upskilling enable leaders and employees to quickly pivot to market shifts, thereby ensuring the long-term success of any organisation.
Technology Demands Constant Training & Upskilling
As technology continues to evolve, organisations must stay prepared for the next phase of their industry. Leaders who invest in upskilling themselves and their teams can prepare for the future by identifying emerging trends, adopting new technologies, and building new capabilities. This helps future-proof the business and ensures that it remains relevant and competitive in the years to come. Upskilling helps leaders and their organisations to build resilience. By developing new skills, capabilities, and mindsets, leaders can navigate challenges and setbacks with confidence, knowing that they have the tools and expertise to overcome any obstacle.
Levelling Up
Prioritising training and upskilling foster a culture of continuous learning and development within organisations. This encourages employees to acquire new skills and tackle new challenges, ultimately boosting overall engagement. Continuous learning also enables leaders to attract and retain top talent by investing in talent development, which further strengthens the organisation.
Difference between Upskilling & Reskilling
Upskilling involves improving the skills and abilities of existing employees to advance in their current roles and careers within the organisation. It also helps to minimize skill gaps, if any, in the workplace. Reskilling, on the other hand, focuses on training staff for different jobs. Both objectives are generally achieved through training and other learning and development initiatives.
Physical and Emotional Well-Being
The post-COVID era has highlighted the importance of ensuring the mental health and well-being of employees,  necessitating support for the development of emotional intelligence, self-care, resilience, and personal growth.  Not only HR but also managers are now required to be more empathetic and proficient in handling employees’ professional and personal challenges,  providing necessary support to ensure the overall well-being. This can only happen when leaders and managers are trained to handle such unforeseen circumstances and situations effectively.
Innovation is the key to maintaining a competitive edge, and leaders who upskill can drive innovation within their organizations. By staying current with the latest trends and technologies, leaders can identify new opportunities and develop innovative solutions to meet evolving customer needs. This positions businesses to remain relevant and competitive, even in crowded markets.
Innovation is key to staying ahead of the competition, and leaders who upskill can swiftly drive innovation within their organisations. By staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies, leaders can able to identify new opportunities and accordingly develop innovative solutions that meet the changing needs of the customers. This helps businesses stay relevant and competitive, even in crowded markets.

Post-pandemic, there has been a major shift in the way businesses function. While the stage for business disruption was long set by technological advancements such as AI, automation, and big data analytics, the pandemic acted as a burning matchstick on a pile of fireworks. Overnight,  businesses had to transition to remote work, necessitating the adoption of real-time digital systems to ensure continued productivity. For leaders, this new business landscape brought forth fresh challenges.  The rapidly changing market dynamics coupled with technological advancements compelled businesses to focus on upskilling their employees and management to navigate a complex landscape to stay ahead of the competition.
Businesses must develop leadership talent within their organisations who can translate the company’s vision into action from a strategic point of view. To be impactful in leading their companies in the new world of business, leaders require a specific blend of skills and attributes. Leaders must embrace constant learning while keeping an eye on the future. By upskilling themselves, leaders can anticipate changes and adapt quickly, thereby staying ahead of the competition. This is crucial as training and upskilling enable leaders and employees to quickly pivot to market shifts, thereby ensuring the long-term success of any organisation.
Technology Demands Constant Training & Upskilling
As technology continues to evolve, organisations must stay prepared for the next phase of their industry. Leaders who invest in upskilling themselves and their teams can prepare for the future by identifying emerging trends, adopting new technologies, and building new capabilities. This helps future-proof the business and ensures that it remains relevant and competitive in the years to come. Upskilling helps leaders and their organisations to build resilience. By developing new skills, capabilities, and mindsets, leaders can navigate challenges and setbacks with confidence, knowing that they have the tools and expertise to overcome any obstacle.
Levelling Up
Prioritising training and upskilling foster a culture of continuous learning and development within organisations. This encourages employees to acquire new skills and tackle new challenges, ultimately boosting overall engagement. Continuous learning also enables leaders to attract and retain top talent by investing in talent development, which further strengthens the organisation.
Difference between Upskilling & Reskilling
Upskilling involves improving the skills and abilities of existing employees to advance in their current roles and careers within the organisation. It also helps to minimize skill gaps, if any, in the workplace. Reskilling, on the other hand, focuses on training staff for different jobs. Both objectives are generally achieved through training and other learning and development initiatives.
Physical and Emotional Well-Being
The post-COVID era has highlighted the importance of ensuring the mental health and well-being of employees,  necessitating support for the development of emotional intelligence, self-care, resilience, and personal growth.  Not only HR but also managers are now required to be more empathetic and proficient in handling employees’ professional and personal challenges,  providing necessary support to ensure the overall well-being. This can only happen when leaders and managers are trained to handle such unforeseen circumstances and situations effectively.
Innovation is the key to maintaining a competitive edge, and leaders who upskill can drive innovation within their organizations. By staying current with the latest trends and technologies, leaders can identify new opportunities and develop innovative solutions to meet evolving customer needs. This positions businesses to remain relevant and competitive, even in crowded markets.
Innovation is key to staying ahead of the competition, and leaders who upskill can swiftly drive innovation within their organisations.
