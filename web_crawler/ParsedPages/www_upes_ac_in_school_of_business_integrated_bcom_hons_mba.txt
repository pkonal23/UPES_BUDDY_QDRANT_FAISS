They can work on projects related to green finance, socially responsible investing, and sustainable insurance products.

Graduates who understand regulatory frameworks, compliance requirements, and risk management will be in demand. They can work as compliance officers, regulatory analysts, or consultants, ensuring regulation adherence, implementing governance frameworks, and managing regulatory risks.
Entrepreneurship and Consulting: Graduates with a combination of business management skills and specialised knowledge in banking and insurance can explore entrepreneurial opportunities in the fintech or insurtech sectors. They can launch their startups, offer consulting services to banks and insurance companies, or work with technology firms to develop innovative financial solutions.
