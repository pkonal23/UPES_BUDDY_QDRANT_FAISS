Dr. Shreya Banerjee

Assistant Professor-Senior Scale

Profile Summary
She is an assistant professor at the School of Computer Science, UPES in Dehradun, India. Previously, she worked as a postdoctoral scholar at the Institute quantique, University of Sherbrooke. Her research is primarily focused on studying quantum systems and their application in cutting edge technologies. During her doctoral studies, she had explored the geometry of qudit entangled states and formed a novel approach to quantify multiparty distributive entanglement. Alongside, she studied the dynamics of the non-local correlations in open quantum systems and was involved in developing protocols and algorithms using quantum and semi-quantum tools. Further, she has experience in implementation of quantum algorithms and protocols using Quimb (a Tensor Network library), IBM Quantum, Qiskit, Openqasm, as well as in numerical computation using GNU-Octave, Matlab, and Mathematica. She wants to carry forward her studies of quantum systems in my future research career.
Work Experience
She has 2+ years of post-PhD research and teaching experiences including both academia and industry.
Assistant Professor (Senior Scale) at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun- (Oct 2023 – Present)
