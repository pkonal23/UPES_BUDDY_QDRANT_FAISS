Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Uday Bhaskar Sharma is one of the faculty members of UPES School of Liberal Studies and Media. He has expertise in Mathematics, more specifically in areas like combinatorics and group theory. He is the Programme Lead for B. Sc. In Applied Mathematics and Statistics being offered by the School of Liberal Studies and Media. His research works are published in journals of repute at national and international levels journals.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Dr. Sharma did his post-doctoral work at two very well-known institutes, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) Mumbai. He did his Ph.D. from the highly reputed Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.
Research Interests
Group Theory | Combinatorics | Representation Theory
Dr. Sharma has maintained a wide research domain within the discipline of mathematics. He has published 4 papers and is on the way to publishing two more.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Uday Bhaskar Sharma’s teaching philosophy focusses on student-centric learning processes. He believes in motivating students by citing examples from daily life and using his extra-curricular skills in origami and art to make models and pictures relevant to the subject for the students to visualize. He strongly believes in giving the students a hands-on experience of the topic through rigourous sessions of tutorials.
Courses Taught
Dr. Sharma taught an introductory course to algebra called ‘Algebra-I’ in the winter semester from January to April 2023. In this topic, he introduced the basic concepts of Group Theory to the B.Sc. students at the School of Liberal Studies and Media. He also taught the Discrete Mathematics module, covering Logic and Graph Theory, as a part of the PhD. course ‘Critical Approaches to Liberal Arts’.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Sharma received the University Gold Medal during his Masters in University of Hyderabad in 2011.
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Sharma has co-designed the course grid for the B.Sc. Applied Mathematics and Statistics for the students of the School of Liberal Studies and Media.
