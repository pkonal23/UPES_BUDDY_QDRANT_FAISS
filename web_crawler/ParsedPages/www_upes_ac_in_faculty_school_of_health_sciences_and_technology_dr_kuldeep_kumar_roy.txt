Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Kuldeep Kumar Roy is a seasoned professional with over 15 years of teaching and research experience at several national and international institutions. Dr. Roy earned his Bachelor of Pharmacy (B.Pharm.) and Master of Pharmacy (M.Pharm.) in Pharmaceutical Chemistry degrees from Birla Institute of Technology in Mesra (Ranchi), Jharkhand. He received his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Medicinal Chemistry from the CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute in Lucknow and the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) jointly in New Delhi, India. He spent several years doing postdoctoral research in South Korea and the United States. He specializes in Pharmaceutical Research, Pharmacoinformatics, Medicinal Chemistry, and New Drug Discovery, among other things. He is interested in translational drug discovery research for diseases of unmet need by integrating computational modeling and medicinal chemistry. He has received funding support from several government bodies, including the ICMR, CSIR, DST, and DBT. He has three international patents (granted) and over 45 peer-reviewed international publications. He is a reviewer of several international journals and associate editor of Frontiers in Drug Discovery journal.
Work Experience
Dr. Roy is employed at UPES, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, as a Professor and Cluster Head in the Pharmaceutical Sciences cluster, School of Health Sciences and Technology. Before joining UPES in July 2021, he was an Associate Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Medical Sciences, Adamas University, Kolkata, West Bengal (India). From April 2016 until August 2020, he worked as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacoinformatics at the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research Kolkata (NIPER-Kolkata), India. He was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of BioMolecular Sciences at the University of Mississippi, Mississippi, USA, for almost three years (June 2013-March 2016). He formerly worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Ewha University in Seoul, South Korea. Before beginning the doctorate program, he worked as a Scientist-II in the medicinal chemistry section of Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. in Gujarat (India) after completing his post-graduation.
Research Interests
He has research interests in translational drug discovery research for diseases of unmet need through the integration of computational modeling and medicinal chemistry.
Teaching Philosophy
A teacher or instructor lays seeds of knowledge that will develop indefinitely. As a teacher, he thinks each student is a unique seed that requires a stimulating atmosphere to develop, mature, and lead the future. His teaching philosophy may be summarised in four words: involvement, encouragement, exploration, and cross-learning. In his opinion, students learn best when actively involved in the learning process. A successful teaching method inspires students to think and discuss by educating them to question, analyze, and test newly acquired knowledge rather than accept it passively. As a teacher, he believes students should be provided with an active platform to learn, practice, and explore core information and abilities.

Before beginning the doctorate program, he worked as a Scientist-II in the medicinal chemistry section of Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. in Gujarat (India) after completing his post-graduation.
Research Interests
He has research interests in translational drug discovery research for diseases of unmet need through the integration of computational modeling and medicinal chemistry.
Teaching Philosophy
A teacher or instructor lays seeds of knowledge that will develop indefinitely. As a teacher, he thinks each student is a unique seed that requires a stimulating atmosphere to develop, mature, and lead the future. His teaching philosophy may be summarised in four words: involvement, encouragement, exploration, and cross-learning. In his opinion, students learn best when actively involved in the learning process. A successful teaching method inspires students to think and discuss by educating them to question, analyze, and test newly acquired knowledge rather than accept it passively. As a teacher, he believes students should be provided with an active platform to learn, practice, and explore core information and abilities.
