The goal emphasizes the significance of global collaboration and partnerships in achieving the other 16 SDGs, specifically focusing on strengthening implementation methods and revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.

SDG 17's objectives comprise the following:
Strengthen domestic resource mobilization to increase domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection, notably through international assistance to underdeveloped nations.
Developed nations should fulfill their obligations to provide official development aid (ODA/GNI) to poor nations at a rate of 0.7% of gross national income, with 0.15% to 0.20% going to the least developed nations.
Raise further funding for developing nations from a variety of sources.
Help developing nations achieve long-term debt sustainability by implementing coordinated policies that support debt financing, relief, and restructuring as necessary. You should also handle the external debt of very indebted poor nations to lessen their financial misery.
Establish and put into effect policies that encourage investment in least developed countries.
Enhance knowledge-sharing and promote regional and international cooperation on science, technology, and innovation, enhancing coordination among current mechanisms.
Promote the development, transfer, and dissemination of environmentally friendly technologies to developing countries on mutually agreed terms. SDG 17 emphasizes on global partnership involving governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations to mobilize resources, share knowledge, and tackle global challenges, aiming to create a more inclusive and cooperative global framework for sustainable development.
