Senior Assistant Professor (Selection Grade)

Profile Summary
Dr. Sambit Prasanajit Naik is a recognized scientist in the fields of Active Tectonics, Paleoseismology, and Earthquake Hazard Estimation, with over a decade of international experience spanning Mexico, the USA, and South Korea. He earned his Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. Dr. Naik is a recipient of the highly coveted TWAS-UNESCO Fellowship, awarded for his groundbreaking research on Active Faults and Paleoseismology. This fellowship, part of the world’s largest South-South research initiative, highlights his contributions to advancing science on a global scale.Before joining UPES, Dr. Naik held the position of Leading Researcher at the  Active Fault and Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Research Institute, South Korea, where he spearheaded key projects in seismic risk mitigation. His career reflects a rare blend of academic excellence, field expertise, and global collaboration, positioning him at the forefront of earthquake hazard research.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Dr. Naik was working as Research professor at the  Active Fault and Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Research Institute, South Korea from 2017-2024. Prior to this he was working as Scientist at UNAM Mexico (2016-2017) which is one of the  Oldest and Prestigious university in Latin America. After completing his Ph.D., he was working as a Senior Research Associate at Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Kanpur from 2014-2016. He is author of more than 50 SCI Journal and conference papers and several book chapters.
Research Interests
Dr. Naik's research interests encompass various aspects,  Active Fault Mapping and Paleoseismic Investigations and earthquake hazard estimation for different regions from different tectonic environments ( intraplate, volcanic and plate boundary regions). One of his major thrust research is application of Geophysical tools (ERT, GPR< Seismci Downhole, MASW) for Investigations for shallow subsurface geophysical investigation. He is interested in Soil Liquefaction Potential evaluation (both experimental and analytical) and its mitigation using different sustainable material such as activated carbon.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Naik adopts a practical, student-centered approach to teaching, focusing on cultivating critical thinking and problem-solving skills rather than rote memorization. He fosters a positive, creative, and collaborative classroom environment that encourages open communication between students and teachers, eliminating barriers and enhancing learning outcomes. Committed to building students' confidence, Dr. Naik emphasizes a solid grasp of fundamental concepts, empowering them to engage actively with the subject matter. His teaching approach integrates fieldwork, analytical methods, and the use of modern geological software, equipping students with the practical skills needed to observe, collect, and interpret data effectively.With a passion for teaching and hands-on learning, Dr. Naik guides his students through real-world geological challenges, inspiring them to think innovatively and develop a professional approach to problem-solving. Through field exercises, practical applications, and personalized mentorship, he strives to ignite a genuine interest in geology while building a strong academic and scientific foundation for future endeavors.
Courses Taught
Dr. Sambit Prasanajit Naik has taught a diverse range of courses such as Indian Stratigraphy, Metamorphic Petrology, Geochemistry, and Geophysics. His teaching approach integrates theoretical insights with practical applications, equipping students with the skills needed to excel both academically and professionally in the field of geosciences. With a deep commitment to delivering comprehensive and interdisciplinary knowledge, Dr. Naik ensures that students develop a holistic understanding of geoscience concepts.
Awards and Grants
DST Grant for conducting his Ph.D research at IIT Kanpur
TWAS Postdoctoral Fellowship for working at UNAM Mexico towards active fault mapping and Paleoseismic investigations along the 2010 Baja California earthquake and other fault sin Central Mexico.
Several Travel Grants from INQUA for attending conferences like PATA Days, INQUA Annual Congress
Travel Grants from Ministry of Interior Safety Korea for attending training Program at Geological Survey of Japan towards advancement of  Active Fault studies in Japan and Seismic Hazard assessment and Early Warning Systems.

Before joining UPES, Dr. Naik was working as Research professor at the  Active Fault and Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Research Institute, South Korea from 2017-2024. Prior to this he was working as Scientist at UNAM Mexico (2016-2017) which is one of the  Oldest and Prestigious university in Latin America. After completing his Ph.D., he was working as a Senior Research Associate at Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Kanpur from 2014-2016. He is author of more than 50 SCI Journal and conference papers and several book chapters.
Research Interests
Dr. Naik's research interests encompass various aspects,  Active Fault Mapping and Paleoseismic Investigations and earthquake hazard estimation for different regions from different tectonic environments ( intraplate, volcanic and plate boundary regions). One of his major thrust research is application of Geophysical tools (ERT, GPR< Seismci Downhole, MASW) for Investigations for shallow subsurface geophysical investigation. He is interested in Soil Liquefaction Potential evaluation (both experimental and analytical) and its mitigation using different sustainable material such as activated carbon.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Naik adopts a practical, student-centered approach to teaching, focusing on cultivating critical thinking and problem-solving skills rather than rote memorization. He fosters a positive, creative, and collaborative classroom environment that encourages open communication between students and teachers, eliminating barriers and enhancing learning outcomes. Committed to building students' confidence, Dr. Naik emphasizes a solid grasp of fundamental concepts, empowering them to engage actively with the subject matter. His teaching approach integrates fieldwork, analytical methods, and the use of modern geological software, equipping students with the practical skills needed to observe, collect, and interpret data effectively.With a passion for teaching and hands-on learning, Dr. Naik guides his students through real-world geological challenges, inspiring them to think innovatively and develop a professional approach to problem-solving. Through field exercises, practical applications, and personalized mentorship, he strives to ignite a genuine interest in geology while building a strong academic and scientific foundation for future endeavors.
Courses Taught
Dr. Sambit Prasanajit Naik has taught a diverse range of courses such as Indian Stratigraphy, Metamorphic Petrology, Geochemistry, and Geophysics. His teaching approach integrates theoretical insights with practical applications, equipping students with the skills needed to excel both academically and professionally in the field of geosciences. With a deep commitment to delivering comprehensive and interdisciplinary knowledge, Dr. Naik ensures that students develop a holistic understanding of geoscience concepts.
Awards and Grants
DST Grant for conducting his Ph.D research at IIT Kanpur
TWAS Postdoctoral Fellowship for working at UNAM Mexico towards active fault mapping and Paleoseismic investigations along the 2010 Baja California earthquake and other fault sin Central Mexico.
Several Travel Grants from INQUA for attending conferences like PATA Days, INQUA Annual Congress
