SDG 1: No Poverty: End poverty in all its forms, everywhere
Manvi Vats, UPES School of Law, HIM Foundation
Joining HIM Foundation under the guidance of our mentor, Ajay Bahuguna Sir through the Srijan Social Internship has been a transformative experience. Our work here is truly inspiring, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute. Initially, many of us had no practical experience in social work, but the NGO's dedication to positive change quickly motivated us to get involved.
One of the most impactful experiences was visiting zones to celebrate special occasions with donors and meet underprivileged communities. Understanding their hardships firsthand has profoundly changed me. I now empathise with their struggles and am more committed to making a difference.
Working with HIM Foundation has equipped me with essential skills. I have enhanced my communication and organisational abilities, learned the importance of empathy and active listening, and developed a stronger sense of social responsibility. According to the World Bank, approximately 10% of the world's population lives on less than $1.90 daily, highlighting the urgent need for social initiatives like ours.
I am proud to be part of an organisation that spreads happiness and strives to improve lives. This experience has made me a better person and a more capable future lawyer. I am committed to continuing this journey of change and positively impacting society.
Sanjhi Pareek, UPES School of Computer Sciences, SAMRAS BHARAT SEVA SANSTHAN
Working with SAMRAS BHARAT SEVA SANSTHAN has profoundly impacted both the community and my personal growth. Our efforts to eradicate child labour and alleviate poverty have made significant strides. By establishing educational programs, we provided former child laborers with access to schooling, textbooks, and uniforms, enabling them to break free from the cycle of poverty. Our economic support initiatives, including microfinance and vocational training for families, empowered parents to achieve financial stability, reducing their reliance on their children’s earnings. Additionally, our health and nutrition programs improved the overall well-being of these children, ensuring they could focus on their education without health-related distractions. Through awareness campaigns, we shifted public perceptions of child labour and garnered community support for our cause. Personally, this experience has deepened my empathy and understanding of the impact of poverty, strengthened my belief in the power of collective action, and enhanced my resilience in addressing complex social issues. This transformative journey has reinforced my commitment to fighting poverty and supporting social justice, fuelling my aspiration to create a world where every child can thrive free from exploitation and deprivation.
SDG 2: Zero Hunger: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture
Anshul Paliwal, UPES School of Computer Science, Divya Prem Seva Mission
My internship with Divya Prem Seva Mission, organised by UPES, was a transformative journey focused on addressing hunger in underserved communities. Engaging in daily food distribution, I witnessed the profound impact of providing free lunches to those in need. The gratitude and relief on the recipients' faces gave me a deep appreciation for the power of simple acts of kindness in combating hunger.
As the group lead, I developed essential skills in communication, organization, and leadership. I was responsible for filling up the Daily Report Record (DRR), ensuring team cohesion, and guiding my peers to fulfill their duties effectively. This role honed my ability to manage conflicts and maintain focus on our objectives, crucial skills for any leadership position.
Participating in the NGO's daily operations, including watering plants and handling administrative tasks, broadened my understanding of the organization's functioning and underscored the importance of every task, no matter how minor, in achieving our mission.
A particularly memorable experience was when my scooter was stolen and later recovered, teaching me resilience and adaptability. This incident reinforced the importance of maintaining a positive, solution-oriented mindset in the face of challenges.
Overall, my time at Divya Prem Seva Mission was pivotal in shaping my perspectives on social service and community engagement. The skills and insights I gained, particularly in leadership, communication, and problem-solving, are invaluable for my future career. I am committed to using these lessons to contribute to the Zero Hunger SDG and create a more equitable and just society.
SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages
Arpita Maurya, UPES School of Business, Aastha Centre for Geriatric Medicine and Hospice
Working at the Aastha Centre for Geriatric Medicine and Hospice has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life. I have had the opportunity to contribute to my community in various impactful ways, starting with organising and participating in donation drives to support local shelters. Providing essential supplies to those in need has been incredibly fulfilling, knowing that we are making a tangible difference in their lives.
Regular visits to elderly residents in nursing homes have been equally rewarding. Engaging them in meaningful conversations and arranging activities like dance, music, and games enriched their lives and taught me the value of empathy and compassion. The joy and gratitude expressed by the elderly residents made every effort worthwhile.
In addition to my work with the elderly, I offered free tutoring sessions to students, helping them improve academically and providing guidance on their career choices. This mentorship role allowed me to support the next generation in achieving their academic goals and making informed decisions about their futures. Seeing the students excel and gain confidence has been one of the highlights of my experience.
These efforts have not only benefited the individuals I interacted with, but also fostered a stronger, more supportive community. I have become more empathetic, organized, and compassionate, dedicated to making a positive difference in society.
Participating in the Srijan Social Internship program provided me with the platform and support to engage deeply with my community and make a tangible impact. This experience has further fueled my commitment to social service and community building.
I am immensely grateful to my mentor, Dr. Abhishek Shukla Sir, Founder and Secretary of Aastha Hospice. His guidance and support have shaped my understanding of community service and palliative care.
Isha Singh Chandel, UPES School of Business, District Taekwondo Association
During my internship with the District Taekwondo Association, I organiSed the Taekwondo Poomsae Training and Referee Education Program, which made a significant impact on our community. This initiative not only promoted physical fitness but also instilled important life skills such as discipline and perseverance. Participants, especially youth, benefited from improved health and increased self-confidence, fostering personal development and a healthier lifestyle.
The referee education component provided valuable skills and potential career opportunities, enhancing the professional landscape of Taekwondo in our region. Additionally, our three-day visit to Sunbeam School Babatpur, which included health check-ups and counselling sessions, addressed the holistic well-being of students. This effort supported their academic and emotional needs, contributing to a more resilient and informed community.
My experience deepened my empathy and leadership skills, as working closely with diverse groups taught me the importance of active listening and effective support. The satisfaction of seeing positive changes in the community has strengthened my commitment to service and personal growth. This journey has shaped me into a more compassionate and dedicated individual, eager to continue contributing to societal well-being and development.
Nisha Jyala, School of Computer Science, Human For Humanity
During my social internship with Human For Humanity, I embarked on a journey, that was both fulfilling and transformative. This experience has left me with a deep sense of satisfaction and pride, knowing that our efforts made a tangible difference in the lives of women and girls in the community.
Our primary focus was on menstrual hygiene and women’s health, addressing a critical issue often shrouded in stigma and misinformation. We distributed reusable sanitary pads to women and girls who lacked access to affordable and sustainable menstrual products. This initiative not only met their immediate needs but also promoted long-term sustainability by reducing reliance on costly and environmentally harmful disposable products.
Our efforts extended beyond just the women and girls; we also involved men and community leaders in our programs. By educating them about the importance of menstrual hygiene and fostering a supportive attitude, we worked towards creating a more inclusive and understanding community. This holistic approach helped reduce the stigma associated with menstruation and encouraged a more open dialogue on the topic.
Seeing the tangible improvements in the lives of women and girls, and knowing that our efforts contributed to their health and empowerment, has been immensely rewarding. This internship has heightened my sense of responsibility and commitment to continue working towards social change. The stories and experiences of the people I met have left a lasting impression on me, motivating me to pursue further studies and a career in public health and social development.
I am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of this journey, and I am determined to continue advocating for women’s health and education, both immediately and in the long term.
Aishwarya Uniyal, UPES School of Law, Cristina Society
During my internship with Cristina Society, I had the opportunity to contribute to the community in various meaningful ways. I distributed stationery items and food to children, organised free healthcare campaigns for women, distributed sanitary pads, and conducted cleanliness campaigns. My focus was on child education, planting various plants and seeds, and providing food to cows, cats, and dogs. Additionally, I distributed free healthcare kits in Rishikesh.
This experience made me realise the importance of the environment, food for the underprivileged, child education, and public awareness. Personally, I felt immense gratitude when I saw the smiles on children’s faces after giving them food.
Staying with underprivileged children is often considered a taboo in society, but I realised that these children are very interactive and eager to learn. Distributing stationery was done to promote child education, and spending time with them was far from boring; it was fulfilling to provide them with necessities.
SDG 4: Quality Education: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Prackirnan Singh, UPES School of Advanced Engineering, Manviya Prabhandhan Sansthan
I am currently doing my Srijan Internship at Manviya Prabandhan Sansthan. In June, during the peak of summer, we organised a plantation drive. The joy of planting seeds on Environment Day was contagious. On World Yoga Day, my colleagues and I taught ITI students various yoga asanas to enhance flexibility and joint relief.
Our mentor arranged for us to interact with the students three times a week, during which we introduced them to Canva.
They were delighted to learn how to create banners and edit videos and pictures using the platform's features. We also educated them about aptitude tests and competitive exams, sharing tips and strategies to excel in these areas. This helped boost their confidence and preparedness for future job pursuits.
Additionally, our NGO hosted a camp to assist the community in completing essential documents like Aadhaar cards, driving licences, and PAN cards. We emphasised the importance of communication skills and organised friendly debates to build confidence and enhance critical thinking.
Working with the students of ITI was a rewarding experience. They were initially unfamiliar with Canva, but our guidance made the editing process easy and enjoyable for them. Providing information about aptitude tests and competitive exams gave them the knowledge and confidence to succeed. The debates we held stimulated their thinking and observation skills, and they appreciated the benefits of yoga for physical and mental well-being.
I discovered my passion for teaching and sharing knowledge. I gained confidence in addressing groups and enjoyed the teaching experience immensely. Witnessing the students pass on the knowledge about essential documents to the public was fulfilling.
Parnavi Singh, UPES School of Business, Parivartan Social Foundation
At Parivartan Social Foundation, my journey has been both transformative for the community and personally enriching. My role focused on creating highly engaging and meaningful educational content tailored for high school students in rural areas who were preparing for their board exams. Acknowledging the unique challenges these students face, especially with complex subjects like mathematics and science, I developed interactive PowerPoint presentations and integrated video content to make these topics more accessible and enjoyable.
The educational resources I created were designed to simplify intricate concepts into more understandable segments. By utilising visual aids, real-life examples, and step-by-step explanations, these materials helped bridge the gap between challenging subject matter and student comprehension. The interactive nature of the presentations and engaging video content not only enhanced understanding but also made learning a more enjoyable experience. This approach was crucial for keeping students motivated and interested, which is essential for effective learning.
The impact of these resources was greatly amplified by the dedication of our ground-level volunteers. They played a vital role in distributing the content to students in remote areas and providing on-the-spot assistance to help students navigate through the materials and clarify any doubts. Their support ensured that even those with limited access to educational resources could benefit from our programs.
Feedback from students and teachers was overwhelmingly positive. Many students reported significant improvements in their understanding of complex topics, which boosted their confidence and performance in exams. Teachers appreciated the quality and effectiveness of the materials, noting that they complemented traditional teaching methods and served as excellent supplementary resources.
Witnessing the tangible impact of my work on students' educational journeys has been immensely rewarding. Seeing students grasp challenging concepts and hearing their stories of academic improvement has given me a profound sense of fulfilment and purpose. This experience has reinforced my commitment to education and social causes, demonstrating the power of well-designed educational tools and the critical importance of accessibility in learning.
Overall, my time at Parivartan Social Foundation has been deeply fulfilling and has strengthened my resolve to continue contributing to education and social development. The skills and insights gained from this experience will continue to guide me as I strive to bridge educational gaps and support students in need.
Khushi Yadav, UPES School of Computer Science, AICAPD
During my internship with AICAPD, I had the privilege to contribute significantly to the lives of underprivileged children living in slums. My primary role was to assist in educational programs, ensuring that children not only received basic education but also developed skills that would help them secure better opportunities in the future, instead of begging or working as labourers. I taught topics like alphabets, counting, reading and writing words, the meaning of different words, and practical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and self-introduction. Fun activities were also conducted during the internship period. By tailoring the learning experience to the needs and abilities of each child, I was able to make education more accessible and engaging for them.
In addition to education, I participated in initiatives aimed at addressing basic needs such as food distribution and helping families obtain essential identification documents like Aadhaar cards. This initiative ensured that children and their families had the necessary support to focus on education without being burdened by immediate survival concerns.
Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing. A few chess sessions were also conducted during the internship.
On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.
Zoya, School, UPES Computer Science, Global Society of Social Soldiers – GS3
When our college announced a summer social internship organised by our college NGO, GS3, at the local Anganwadi, excitement and curiosity filled the air. An Anganwadi, a rural childcare center in India, plays a crucial role in providing basic education and nutrition to children. Our objective was clear: to make a difference in the lives of these children and their families so that they can have a better future and better living conditions.
A team of dedicated and passionate individuals was formed.

I taught topics like alphabets, counting, reading and writing words, the meaning of different words, and practical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and self-introduction. Fun activities were also conducted during the internship period. By tailoring the learning experience to the needs and abilities of each child, I was able to make education more accessible and engaging for them.
In addition to education, I participated in initiatives aimed at addressing basic needs such as food distribution and helping families obtain essential identification documents like Aadhaar cards. This initiative ensured that children and their families had the necessary support to focus on education without being burdened by immediate survival concerns.
Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing. A few chess sessions were also conducted during the internship.
On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.

Child Help Foundation
Working with the Child Help Foundation to promote the Baby Feeding Centre (BFC) has been a deeply rewarding experience. My efforts to raise awareness about the BFC have significantly impacted the community, ensuring that mothers can travel with their babies without hesitation about feeding them. This initiative supports Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality, by empowering women to participate fully in public life without compromising their roles as caregivers.
The journey began when I learned about the difficulties many mothers faced in finding suitable places to feed their infants while in public. This often led to stress and discomfort, as public breastfeeding was met with disapproval and a lack of support. By promoting the BFC, more mothers are now aware of safe, comfortable spaces available for feeding their infants, which has led to increased confidence and ease for travelling mothers.
We organised street plays at two railway stations to raise public awareness about the importance of the Baby Feeding Centre across Mumbai and other parts of India. The impact of these efforts has been profound. Mothers now feel more confident and comfortable feeding their babies in public spaces, knowing there are dedicated areas for them. This shift has reduced the stigma around public breastfeeding and fostered a culture of support and acceptance. The availability of BFCs has alleviated the anxiety many mothers faced, allowing them to participate more fully in community activities and travel with ease.
Witnessing the appreciation and relief on the faces of mothers who utilise the BFC reassures me that our efforts are making a meaningful difference. This experience has reinforced my commitment to social service and motivated me to continue advocating for initiatives that support the well-being of society and advance gender equality.

I conducted regular sessions on public speaking, art, and drama, encouraging them to share their thoughts and ideas. Witnessing their growth, from hesitant whispers to confident voices, was incredibly rewarding. Students began to express themselves more freely, contributing their ideas in group activities and showcasing their talents in community events.
In addition to these educational activities, I also focused on promoting clean water and sanitation practices within the community. We organised workshops to educate the villagers about the importance of clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene practices. We installed water filters in schools and community centers to ensure access to safe drinking water. We also conducted cleanliness drives to improve sanitation facilities and reduce waterborne diseases. These efforts helped the community understand the significance of clean water and sanitation, leading to healthier and more sustainable living conditions.
This experience has profoundly impacted both the community and my personal growth.

I have learned the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society.

I taught topics like alphabets, counting, reading and writing words, the meaning of different words, and practical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and self-introduction. Fun activities were also conducted during the internship period. By tailoring the learning experience to the needs and abilities of each child, I was able to make education more accessible and engaging for them.
In addition to education, I participated in initiatives aimed at addressing basic needs such as food distribution and helping families obtain essential identification documents like Aadhaar cards. This initiative ensured that children and their families had the necessary support to focus on education without being burdened by immediate survival concerns.
Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing. A few chess sessions were also conducted during the internship.
On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.

I taught topics like alphabets, counting, reading and writing words, the meaning of different words, and practical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and self-introduction. Fun activities were also conducted during the internship period. By tailoring the learning experience to the needs and abilities of each child, I was able to make education more accessible and engaging for them.
In addition to education, I participated in initiatives aimed at addressing basic needs such as food distribution and helping families obtain essential identification documents like Aadhaar cards. This initiative ensured that children and their families had the necessary support to focus on education without being burdened by immediate survival concerns.
Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing. A few chess sessions were also conducted during the internship.
On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.

Child Help Foundation
Working with the Child Help Foundation to promote the Baby Feeding Centre (BFC) has been a deeply rewarding experience. My efforts to raise awareness about the BFC have significantly impacted the community, ensuring that mothers can travel with their babies without hesitation about feeding them. This initiative supports Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality, by empowering women to participate fully in public life without compromising their roles as caregivers.
The journey began when I learned about the difficulties many mothers faced in finding suitable places to feed their infants while in public. This often led to stress and discomfort, as public breastfeeding was met with disapproval and a lack of support. By promoting the BFC, more mothers are now aware of safe, comfortable spaces available for feeding their infants, which has led to increased confidence and ease for travelling mothers.
We organised street plays at two railway stations to raise public awareness about the importance of the Baby Feeding Centre across Mumbai and other parts of India. The impact of these efforts has been profound. Mothers now feel more confident and comfortable feeding their babies in public spaces, knowing there are dedicated areas for them. This shift has reduced the stigma around public breastfeeding and fostered a culture of support and acceptance. The availability of BFCs has alleviated the anxiety many mothers faced, allowing them to participate more fully in community activities and travel with ease.
Witnessing the appreciation and relief on the faces of mothers who utilise the BFC reassures me that our efforts are making a meaningful difference. This experience has reinforced my commitment to social service and motivated me to continue advocating for initiatives that support the well-being of society and advance gender equality.

I conducted regular sessions on public speaking, art, and drama, encouraging them to share their thoughts and ideas. Witnessing their growth, from hesitant whispers to confident voices, was incredibly rewarding. Students began to express themselves more freely, contributing their ideas in group activities and showcasing their talents in community events.
In addition to these educational activities, I also focused on promoting clean water and sanitation practices within the community. We organised workshops to educate the villagers about the importance of clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene practices. We installed water filters in schools and community centers to ensure access to safe drinking water. We also conducted cleanliness drives to improve sanitation facilities and reduce waterborne diseases. These efforts helped the community understand the significance of clean water and sanitation, leading to healthier and more sustainable living conditions.
This experience has profoundly impacted both the community and my personal growth.

I have learned the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society.

Additionally, it broadened my perspective, enriching my understanding of diverse experiences and viewpoints. This journey has been deeply fulfilling, driving me to continue working towards a more just and equitable world for all children.
Pratham Agrawal, UPES School of Business, Viklang Seva Bharti
During my time at Viklang Seva Bharti, an NGO focused on supporting disabled individuals, I played a key role in advancing the organisation's operational efficiency and supporting its mission of promoting inclusive economic growth. My primary contribution was digitizing the student records, which had previously been managed manually. I consolidated all student information into a centralized digital system, creating individual PDFs and organised folders for each class. This significant upgrade not only streamlined administrative processes but also improved the accessibility and management of vital data.
Beyond the technical contributions, this experience has deepened my understanding of the intersection between support services and economic empowerment. By enhancing the NGO’s operational efficiency, I contributed to creating a more organised and effective environment for delivering support services. This, in turn, supports the broader goal of fostering decent work and economic growth by ensuring that the NGO’s resources are utilised efficiently and its impact on the community is maximised.
Personally, working with the disabled community has fostered empathy and a deeper appreciation for the importance of inclusive and supportive work environments.

I taught topics like alphabets, counting, reading and writing words, the meaning of different words, and practical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and self-introduction. Fun activities were also conducted during the internship period. By tailoring the learning experience to the needs and abilities of each child, I was able to make education more accessible and engaging for them.
In addition to education, I participated in initiatives aimed at addressing basic needs such as food distribution and helping families obtain essential identification documents like Aadhaar cards. This initiative ensured that children and their families had the necessary support to focus on education without being burdened by immediate survival concerns.
Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing. A few chess sessions were also conducted during the internship.
On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.

I taught topics like alphabets, counting, reading and writing words, the meaning of different words, and practical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and self-introduction. Fun activities were also conducted during the internship period. By tailoring the learning experience to the needs and abilities of each child, I was able to make education more accessible and engaging for them.
In addition to education, I participated in initiatives aimed at addressing basic needs such as food distribution and helping families obtain essential identification documents like Aadhaar cards. This initiative ensured that children and their families had the necessary support to focus on education without being burdened by immediate survival concerns.
Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing. A few chess sessions were also conducted during the internship.
On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.

Child Help Foundation
Working with the Child Help Foundation to promote the Baby Feeding Centre (BFC) has been a deeply rewarding experience. My efforts to raise awareness about the BFC have significantly impacted the community, ensuring that mothers can travel with their babies without hesitation about feeding them. This initiative supports Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality, by empowering women to participate fully in public life without compromising their roles as caregivers.
The journey began when I learned about the difficulties many mothers faced in finding suitable places to feed their infants while in public. This often led to stress and discomfort, as public breastfeeding was met with disapproval and a lack of support. By promoting the BFC, more mothers are now aware of safe, comfortable spaces available for feeding their infants, which has led to increased confidence and ease for travelling mothers.
We organised street plays at two railway stations to raise public awareness about the importance of the Baby Feeding Centre across Mumbai and other parts of India. The impact of these efforts has been profound. Mothers now feel more confident and comfortable feeding their babies in public spaces, knowing there are dedicated areas for them. This shift has reduced the stigma around public breastfeeding and fostered a culture of support and acceptance. The availability of BFCs has alleviated the anxiety many mothers faced, allowing them to participate more fully in community activities and travel with ease.
Witnessing the appreciation and relief on the faces of mothers who utilise the BFC reassures me that our efforts are making a meaningful difference. This experience has reinforced my commitment to social service and motivated me to continue advocating for initiatives that support the well-being of society and advance gender equality.

I conducted regular sessions on public speaking, art, and drama, encouraging them to share their thoughts and ideas. Witnessing their growth, from hesitant whispers to confident voices, was incredibly rewarding. Students began to express themselves more freely, contributing their ideas in group activities and showcasing their talents in community events.
In addition to these educational activities, I also focused on promoting clean water and sanitation practices within the community. We organised workshops to educate the villagers about the importance of clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene practices. We installed water filters in schools and community centers to ensure access to safe drinking water. We also conducted cleanliness drives to improve sanitation facilities and reduce waterborne diseases. These efforts helped the community understand the significance of clean water and sanitation, leading to healthier and more sustainable living conditions.

Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing.

On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.

Working with the Child Help Foundation to promote the Baby Feeding Centre (BFC) has been a deeply rewarding experience. My efforts to raise awareness about the BFC have significantly impacted the community, ensuring that mothers can travel with their babies without hesitation about feeding them. This initiative supports Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality, by empowering women to participate fully in public life without compromising their roles as caregivers.
The journey began when I learned about the difficulties many mothers faced in finding suitable places to feed their infants while in public. This often led to stress and discomfort, as public breastfeeding was met with disapproval and a lack of support. By promoting the BFC, more mothers are now aware of safe, comfortable spaces available for feeding their infants, which has led to increased confidence and ease for travelling mothers.
We organised street plays at two railway stations to raise public awareness about the importance of the Baby Feeding Centre across Mumbai and other parts of India. The impact of these efforts has been profound. Mothers now feel more confident and comfortable feeding their babies in public spaces, knowing there are dedicated areas for them. This shift has reduced the stigma around public breastfeeding and fostered a culture of support and acceptance. The availability of BFCs has alleviated the anxiety many mothers faced, allowing them to participate more fully in community activities and travel with ease.
Witnessing the appreciation and relief on the faces of mothers who utilise the BFC reassures me that our efforts are making a meaningful difference. This experience has reinforced my commitment to social service and motivated me to continue advocating for initiatives that support the well-being of society and advance gender equality.

I conducted regular sessions on public speaking, art, and drama, encouraging them to share their thoughts and ideas. Witnessing their growth, from hesitant whispers to confident voices, was incredibly rewarding. Students began to express themselves more freely, contributing their ideas in group activities and showcasing their talents in community events.
In addition to these educational activities, I also focused on promoting clean water and sanitation practices within the community. We organised workshops to educate the villagers about the importance of clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene practices. We installed water filters in schools and community centers to ensure access to safe drinking water. We also conducted cleanliness drives to improve sanitation facilities and reduce waterborne diseases. These efforts helped the community understand the significance of clean water and sanitation, leading to healthier and more sustainable living conditions.

Additionally, our health and nutrition programs improved the overall well-being of these children, ensuring they could focus on their education without health-related distractions. Through awareness campaigns, we shifted public perceptions of child labour and garnered community support for our cause. Personally, this experience has deepened my empathy and understanding of the impact of poverty, strengthened my belief in the power of collective action, and enhanced my resilience in addressing complex social issues. This transformative journey has reinforced my commitment to fighting poverty and supporting social justice, fuelling my aspiration to create a world where every child can thrive free from exploitation and deprivation.

Manvi Vats, UPES School of Law, HIM Foundation

Joining HIM Foundation under the guidance of our mentor, Ajay Bahuguna Sir through the Srijan Social Internship has been a transformative experience. Our work here is truly inspiring, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute. Initially, many of us had no practical experience in social work, but the NGO's dedication to positive change quickly motivated us to get involved.
One of the most impactful experiences was visiting zones to celebrate special occasions with donors and meet underprivileged communities. Understanding their hardships firsthand has profoundly changed me. I now empathise with their struggles and am more committed to making a difference.

Working with HIM Foundation has equipped me with essential skills. I have enhanced my communication and organisational abilities, learned the importance of empathy and active listening, and developed a stronger sense of social responsibility. According to the World Bank, approximately 10% of the world's population lives on less than $1.90 daily, highlighting the urgent need for social initiatives like ours.
I am proud to be part of an organisation that spreads happiness and strives to improve lives. This experience has made me a better person and a more capable future lawyer. I am committed to continuing this journey of change and positively impacting society.

SDG 2: Zero Hunger: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture
Anshul Paliwal, UPES School of Computer Science, Divya Prem Seva Mission
My internship with Divya Prem Seva Mission, organised by UPES, was a transformative journey focused on addressing hunger in underserved communities. Engaging in daily food distribution, I witnessed the profound impact of providing free lunches to those in need. The gratitude and relief on the recipients' faces gave me a deep appreciation for the power of simple acts of kindness in combating hunger.
As the group lead, I developed essential skills in communication, organization, and leadership. I was responsible for filling up the Daily Report Record (DRR), ensuring team cohesion, and guiding my peers to fulfill their duties effectively. This role honed my ability to manage conflicts and maintain focus on our objectives, crucial skills for any leadership position.
Participating in the NGO's daily operations, including watering plants and handling administrative tasks, broadened my understanding of the organization's functioning and underscored the importance of every task, no matter how minor, in achieving our mission.
A particularly memorable experience was when my scooter was stolen and later recovered, teaching me resilience and adaptability. This incident reinforced the importance of maintaining a positive, solution-oriented mindset in the face of challenges.
Overall, my time at Divya Prem Seva Mission was pivotal in shaping my perspectives on social service and community engagement. The skills and insights I gained, particularly in leadership, communication, and problem-solving, are invaluable for my future career. I am committed to using these lessons to contribute to the Zero Hunger SDG and create a more equitable and just society.

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages
Arpita Maurya, UPES School of Business, Aastha Centre for Geriatric Medicine and Hospice
Working at the Aastha Centre for Geriatric Medicine and Hospice has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life. I have had the opportunity to contribute to my community in various impactful ways, starting with organising and participating in donation drives to support local shelters. Providing essential supplies to those in need has been incredibly fulfilling, knowing that we are making a tangible difference in their lives.
Regular visits to elderly residents in nursing homes have been equally rewarding. Engaging them in meaningful conversations and arranging activities like dance, music, and games enriched their lives and taught me the value of empathy and compassion. The joy and gratitude expressed by the elderly residents made every effort worthwhile.
In addition to my work with the elderly, I offered free tutoring sessions to students, helping them improve academically and providing guidance on their career choices. This mentorship role allowed me to support the next generation in achieving their academic goals and making informed decisions about their futures. Seeing the students excel and gain confidence has been one of the highlights of my experience.
These efforts have not only benefited the individuals I interacted with, but also fostered a stronger, more supportive community. I have become more empathetic, organized, and compassionate, dedicated to making a positive difference in society.
Participating in the Srijan Social Internship program provided me with the platform and support to engage deeply with my community and make a tangible impact. This experience has further fueled my commitment to social service and community building.
I am immensely grateful to my mentor, Dr. Abhishek Shukla Sir, Founder and Secretary of Aastha Hospice. His guidance and support have shaped my understanding of community service and palliative care.

Nisha Jyala, School of Computer Science, Human For Humanity
During my social internship with Human For Humanity, I embarked on a journey, that was both fulfilling and transformative. This experience has left me with a deep sense of satisfaction and pride, knowing that our efforts made a tangible difference in the lives of women and girls in the community.
Our primary focus was on menstrual hygiene and women’s health, addressing a critical issue often shrouded in stigma and misinformation. We distributed reusable sanitary pads to women and girls who lacked access to affordable and sustainable menstrual products. This initiative not only met their immediate needs but also promoted long-term sustainability by reducing reliance on costly and environmentally harmful disposable products.
Our efforts extended beyond just the women and girls; we also involved men and community leaders in our programs. By educating them about the importance of menstrual hygiene and fostering a supportive attitude, we worked towards creating a more inclusive and understanding community. This holistic approach helped reduce the stigma associated with menstruation and encouraged a more open dialogue on the topic.
Seeing the tangible improvements in the lives of women and girls, and knowing that our efforts contributed to their health and empowerment, has been immensely rewarding. This internship has heightened my sense of responsibility and commitment to continue working towards social change. The stories and experiences of the people I met have left a lasting impression on me, motivating me to pursue further studies and a career in public health and social development.
I am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of this journey, and I am determined to continue advocating for women’s health and education, both immediately and in the long term.
Aishwarya Uniyal, UPES School of Law, Cristina Society
During my internship with Cristina Society, I had the opportunity to contribute to the community in various meaningful ways. I distributed stationery items and food to children, organised free healthcare campaigns for women, distributed sanitary pads, and conducted cleanliness campaigns. My focus was on child education, planting various plants and seeds, and providing food to cows, cats, and dogs. Additionally, I distributed free healthcare kits in Rishikesh.
This experience made me realise the importance of the environment, food for the underprivileged, child education, and public awareness. Personally, I felt immense gratitude when I saw the smiles on children’s faces after giving them food.
Staying with underprivileged children is often considered a taboo in society, but I realised that these children are very interactive and eager to learn. Distributing stationery was done to promote child education, and spending time with them was far from boring; it was fulfilling to provide them with necessities.

SDG 4: Quality Education: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Prackirnan Singh, UPES School of Advanced Engineering, Manviya Prabhandhan Sansthan
I am currently doing my Srijan Internship at Manviya Prabandhan Sansthan. In June, during the peak of summer, we organised a plantation drive. The joy of planting seeds on Environment Day was contagious. On World Yoga Day, my colleagues and I taught ITI students various yoga asanas to enhance flexibility and joint relief.
Our mentor arranged for us to interact with the students three times a week, during which we introduced them to Canva.
They were delighted to learn how to create banners and edit videos and pictures using the platform's features. We also educated them about aptitude tests and competitive exams, sharing tips and strategies to excel in these areas. This helped boost their confidence and preparedness for future job pursuits.
Additionally, our NGO hosted a camp to assist the community in completing essential documents like Aadhaar cards, driving licences, and PAN cards. We emphasised the importance of communication skills and organised friendly debates to build confidence and enhance critical thinking.
Working with the students of ITI was a rewarding experience. They were initially unfamiliar with Canva, but our guidance made the editing process easy and enjoyable for them. Providing information about aptitude tests and competitive exams gave them the knowledge and confidence to succeed. The debates we held stimulated their thinking and observation skills, and they appreciated the benefits of yoga for physical and mental well-being.
I discovered my passion for teaching and sharing knowledge. I gained confidence in addressing groups and enjoyed the teaching experience immensely. Witnessing the students pass on the knowledge about essential documents to the public was fulfilling.
Parnavi Singh, UPES School of Business, Parivartan Social Foundation
At Parivartan Social Foundation, my journey has been both transformative for the community and personally enriching. My role focused on creating highly engaging and meaningful educational content tailored for high school students in rural areas who were preparing for their board exams. Acknowledging the unique challenges these students face, especially with complex subjects like mathematics and science, I developed interactive PowerPoint presentations and integrated video content to make these topics more accessible and enjoyable.
The educational resources I created were designed to simplify intricate concepts into more understandable segments. By utilising visual aids, real-life examples, and step-by-step explanations, these materials helped bridge the gap between challenging subject matter and student comprehension. The interactive nature of the presentations and engaging video content not only enhanced understanding but also made learning a more enjoyable experience. This approach was crucial for keeping students motivated and interested, which is essential for effective learning.
The impact of these resources was greatly amplified by the dedication of our ground-level volunteers. They played a vital role in distributing the content to students in remote areas and providing on-the-spot assistance to help students navigate through the materials and clarify any doubts. Their support ensured that even those with limited access to educational resources could benefit from our programs.
Feedback from students and teachers was overwhelmingly positive. Many students reported significant improvements in their understanding of complex topics, which boosted their confidence and performance in exams. Teachers appreciated the quality and effectiveness of the materials, noting that they complemented traditional teaching methods and served as excellent supplementary resources.
Witnessing the tangible impact of my work on students' educational journeys has been immensely rewarding. Seeing students grasp challenging concepts and hearing their stories of academic improvement has given me a profound sense of fulfilment and purpose. This experience has reinforced my commitment to education and social causes, demonstrating the power of well-designed educational tools and the critical importance of accessibility in learning.
Overall, my time at Parivartan Social Foundation has been deeply fulfilling and has strengthened my resolve to continue contributing to education and social development. The skills and insights gained from this experience will continue to guide me as I strive to bridge educational gaps and support students in need.
Khushi Yadav, UPES School of Computer Science, AICAPD
During my internship with AICAPD, I had the privilege to contribute significantly to the lives of underprivileged children living in slums. My primary role was to assist in educational programs, ensuring that children not only received basic education but also developed skills that would help them secure better opportunities in the future, instead of begging or working as labourers. I taught topics like alphabets, counting, reading and writing words, the meaning of different words, and practical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and self-introduction. Fun activities were also conducted during the internship period. By tailoring the learning experience to the needs and abilities of each child, I was able to make education more accessible and engaging for them.
In addition to education, I participated in initiatives aimed at addressing basic needs such as food distribution and helping families obtain essential identification documents like Aadhaar cards. This initiative ensured that children and their families had the necessary support to focus on education without being burdened by immediate survival concerns.
Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing. A few chess sessions were also conducted during the internship.
On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.
Zoya, School, UPES Computer Science, Global Society of Social Soldiers – GS3
When our college announced a summer social internship organised by our college NGO, GS3, at the local Anganwadi, excitement and curiosity filled the air. An Anganwadi, a rural childcare center in India, plays a crucial role in providing basic education and nutrition to children. Our objective was clear: to make a difference in the lives of these children and their families so that they can have a better future and better living conditions.
A team of dedicated and passionate individuals was formed. Our NGO mentor and the entire team shared their personal experiences of working in Anganwadis and taught us various ways to provide quality education through games and Teaching Learning Materials (TLMs) to make learning easier for the children.
Our first visit to the Anganwadi was a mix of nervousness and excitement. The children’s curious eyes and shy smiles welcomed us. We conducted educational games and taught them using different TLMs that we had created. Each day brought new challenges, from language barriers to resource limitations, but we overcame these challenges successfully.
The community’s response was heartwarming. Parents expressed gratitude for the health and nutrition tips we provided. Anganwadi workers noted improved engagement and participation from the children. For us, the summer social internship was a lesson in empathy, positive outcomes, and the power of community service.
This internship not only benefited the community but also transformed us into more compassionate individuals. We plan to continue our engagement with the Anganwadi, ensuring sustained support and growth. As we left, a child’s voice echoed in our hearts: “Didi, when will you come back?”
Vanshika Anand, UPES School of Computer Sciences, Optasia Foundation
During my internship with Optasia Foundation, I had the opportunity to contribute significantly to educational development in underprivileged communities. My primary role involved organising and facilitating workshops and extracurricular activities that aimed to enhance students' educational experiences and support their holistic development.
One notable initiative was coordinating a sketching competition at a government school, which provided students with a creative outlet and helped build their confidence. These activities not only engaged students in meaningful ways but also played a crucial role in identifying and nurturing their talents.
Additionally, I led presentations on essential topics such as digital literacy, personal hygiene, and environmental studies for students in grades 6-8. Addressing these subjects fostered open and informed dialogue, crucial for students' physical and emotional well-being. This approach has helped students navigate transitional life phases with greater confidence and understanding.
I also worked on integrating technology into education through platforms like DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing). By providing access to interactive learning modules and resources, we ensured that students from marginalised backgrounds could benefit from modern educational tools, bridging the digital divide.
Personally, this experience has been deeply fulfilling. Witnessing the positive impact on students and the community has reinforced my commitment to education and development. Working with a dedicated team has also strengthened my teamwork and leadership skills.
Overall, my time with Optasia Foundation has been transformative, contributing to the enhancement of educational opportunities and supporting students' growth while aligning with the goals of decent work and economic growth by fostering an inclusive and supportive learning environment.
Nandini Vats, UPES School of Law, Yatan NGO
My internship with YATAN NGO has profoundly transformed my perspective on education and my role in driving social change. YATAN’s dedication to empowering the underprivileged through education deeply resonated with me and fueled my passion for making a difference. Engaging with the children and young adults benefiting from YATAN’s programs was particularly inspiring. Their resilience and determination, especially the young women pursuing their education against significant odds, highlighted the transformative power of education.
Throughout my time with YATAN, I came to understand that education extends beyond knowledge impartation; it’s about empowering individuals to be critical thinkers and active participants in society. YATAN’s comprehensive approach, including life skills training, vocational guidance, and mentorship, is crucial for addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by the underprivileged. I developed a greater appreciation for the significance of early childhood education in shaping a child’s future.
This experience ignited a strong desire to contribute further to the field. I plan to continue volunteering and mentoring with YATAN, using social media and other platforms to raise awareness about the importance of education. Long-term, I aspire to pursue a career in education or social development, aiming to explore and implement innovative approaches that cater to marginalised communities, ensuring everyone has access to quality education and opportunities to succeed.

I discovered my passion for teaching and sharing knowledge. I gained confidence in addressing groups and enjoyed the teaching experience immensely. Witnessing the students pass on the knowledge about essential documents to the public was fulfilling.
Parnavi Singh, UPES School of Business, Parivartan Social Foundation
At Parivartan Social Foundation, my journey has been both transformative for the community and personally enriching. My role focused on creating highly engaging and meaningful educational content tailored for high school students in rural areas who were preparing for their board exams. Acknowledging the unique challenges these students face, especially with complex subjects like mathematics and science, I developed interactive PowerPoint presentations and integrated video content to make these topics more accessible and enjoyable.
The educational resources I created were designed to simplify intricate concepts into more understandable segments. By utilising visual aids, real-life examples, and step-by-step explanations, these materials helped bridge the gap between challenging subject matter and student comprehension. The interactive nature of the presentations and engaging video content not only enhanced understanding but also made learning a more enjoyable experience. This approach was crucial for keeping students motivated and interested, which is essential for effective learning.
The impact of these resources was greatly amplified by the dedication of our ground-level volunteers. They played a vital role in distributing the content to students in remote areas and providing on-the-spot assistance to help students navigate through the materials and clarify any doubts. Their support ensured that even those with limited access to educational resources could benefit from our programs.
Feedback from students and teachers was overwhelmingly positive. Many students reported significant improvements in their understanding of complex topics, which boosted their confidence and performance in exams. Teachers appreciated the quality and effectiveness of the materials, noting that they complemented traditional teaching methods and served as excellent supplementary resources.
Witnessing the tangible impact of my work on students' educational journeys has been immensely rewarding. Seeing students grasp challenging concepts and hearing their stories of academic improvement has given me a profound sense of fulfilment and purpose. This experience has reinforced my commitment to education and social causes, demonstrating the power of well-designed educational tools and the critical importance of accessibility in learning.
Overall, my time at Parivartan Social Foundation has been deeply fulfilling and has strengthened my resolve to continue contributing to education and social development. The skills and insights gained from this experience will continue to guide me as I strive to bridge educational gaps and support students in need.
Khushi Yadav, UPES School of Computer Science, AICAPD
During my internship with AICAPD, I had the privilege to contribute significantly to the lives of underprivileged children living in slums. My primary role was to assist in educational programs, ensuring that children not only received basic education but also developed skills that would help them secure better opportunities in the future, instead of begging or working as labourers. I taught topics like alphabets, counting, reading and writing words, the meaning of different words, and practical skills like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and self-introduction. Fun activities were also conducted during the internship period. By tailoring the learning experience to the needs and abilities of each child, I was able to make education more accessible and engaging for them.
In addition to education, I participated in initiatives aimed at addressing basic needs such as food distribution and helping families obtain essential identification documents like Aadhaar cards. This initiative ensured that children and their families had the necessary support to focus on education without being burdened by immediate survival concerns.
Personally, this experience of working at the NGO has been profoundly fulfilling. Witnessing the enthusiasm and progress of the children has been rewarding. It reinforced my belief in the power of education and community support to transform lives. I feel a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts have contributed to the brighter futures of these children.
The most significant change I have observed in the community is the increased sense of hope and empowerment among the children and their families. Children who initially refused to attend school have now started attending regularly. Those who already attended have become more focused on their studies due to the personal attention given to each student according to their initial knowledge and capabilities by the UPES students. Initially, the parents did not support their children’s education. Now, seeing the benefits of education, they have become more supportive and allow their children to study.
One particular instance that stands out is the story of two young girls, Deepika and Suhani. They are best friends and very bright in their studies. The only thing they require to excel in life is the correct path. Now, they have learned all the basic mathematics, how to introduce themselves in both Hindi and English, basic English, and drawing. A few chess sessions were also conducted during the internship.
On a personal level, this internship has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
In conclusion, my time with the NGO has not only benefited my leadership and communication skills but has also taught me to be grateful for everything life has given me.
Zoya, School, UPES Computer Science, Global Society of Social Soldiers – GS3
When our college announced a summer social internship organised by our college NGO, GS3, at the local Anganwadi, excitement and curiosity filled the air. An Anganwadi, a rural childcare center in India, plays a crucial role in providing basic education and nutrition to children. Our objective was clear: to make a difference in the lives of these children and their families so that they can have a better future and better living conditions.
A team of dedicated and passionate individuals was formed. Our NGO mentor and the entire team shared their personal experiences of working in Anganwadis and taught us various ways to provide quality education through games and Teaching Learning Materials (TLMs) to make learning easier for the children.
Our first visit to the Anganwadi was a mix of nervousness and excitement. The children’s curious eyes and shy smiles welcomed us. We conducted educational games and taught them using different TLMs that we had created. Each day brought new challenges, from language barriers to resource limitations, but we overcame these challenges successfully.
The community’s response was heartwarming. Parents expressed gratitude for the health and nutrition tips we provided. Anganwadi workers noted improved engagement and participation from the children. For us, the summer social internship was a lesson in empathy, positive outcomes, and the power of community service.
This internship not only benefited the community but also transformed us into more compassionate individuals. We plan to continue our engagement with the Anganwadi, ensuring sustained support and growth. As we left, a child’s voice echoed in our hearts: “Didi, when will you come back?”

These activities not only engaged students in meaningful ways but also played a crucial role in identifying and nurturing their talents.
Additionally, I led presentations on essential topics such as digital literacy, personal hygiene, and environmental studies for students in grades 6-8. Addressing these subjects fostered open and informed dialogue, crucial for students' physical and emotional well-being. This approach has helped students navigate transitional life phases with greater confidence and understanding.
I also worked on integrating technology into education through platforms like DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing). By providing access to interactive learning modules and resources, we ensured that students from marginalised backgrounds could benefit from modern educational tools, bridging the digital divide.
Personally, this experience has been deeply fulfilling. Witnessing the positive impact on students and the community has reinforced my commitment to education and development. Working with a dedicated team has also strengthened my teamwork and leadership skills.
Overall, my time with Optasia Foundation has been transformative, contributing to the enhancement of educational opportunities and supporting students' growth while aligning with the goals of decent work and economic growth by fostering an inclusive and supportive learning environment.
Nandini Vats, UPES School of Law, Yatan NGO
My internship with YATAN NGO has profoundly transformed my perspective on education and my role in driving social change. YATAN’s dedication to empowering the underprivileged through education deeply resonated with me and fueled my passion for making a difference. Engaging with the children and young adults benefiting from YATAN’s programs was particularly inspiring. Their resilience and determination, especially the young women pursuing their education against significant odds, highlighted the transformative power of education.
Throughout my time with YATAN, I came to understand that education extends beyond knowledge impartation; it’s about empowering individuals to be critical thinkers and active participants in society. YATAN’s comprehensive approach, including life skills training, vocational guidance, and mentorship, is crucial for addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by the underprivileged. I developed a greater appreciation for the significance of early childhood education in shaping a child’s future.
This experience ignited a strong desire to contribute further to the field. I plan to continue volunteering and mentoring with YATAN, using social media and other platforms to raise awareness about the importance of education. Long-term, I aspire to pursue a career in education or social development, aiming to explore and implement innovative approaches that cater to marginalised communities, ensuring everyone has access to quality education and opportunities to succeed.

Prackirnan Singh, UPES School of Advanced Engineering, Manviya Prabhandhan Sansthan

I am currently doing my Srijan Internship at Manviya Prabandhan Sansthan. In June, during the peak of summer, we organised a plantation drive. The joy of planting seeds on Environment Day was contagious. On World Yoga Day, my colleagues and I taught ITI students various yoga asanas to enhance flexibility and joint relief.

Our mentor arranged for us to interact with the students three times a week, during which we introduced them to Canva.

They were delighted to learn how to create banners and edit videos and pictures using the platform's features. We also educated them about aptitude tests and competitive exams, sharing tips and strategies to excel in these areas. This helped boost their confidence and preparedness for future job pursuits.

SDG 5: Gender Equality: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
Lokesh Singh, Gramyjan Sewa Trust
Interning at Gramyjan Sewa Trust has been a transformative journey. Our mission to empower rural communities and improve their quality of life has significantly impacted various sectors. We organized health camps, awareness programs, and vaccination drives, which have improved health outcomes and reduced disease prevalence in underserved areas. For instance, our health initiatives reached over 1,500 people, providing essential medical services and raising health awareness.
Through our education initiatives, we established schools, provided scholarships, and organised vocational training, resulting in higher literacy rates and increased school enrollment. According to UNESCO education in rural areas can significantly reduce poverty and boost economic growth, which we witnessed firsthand as school attendance in our target areas increased by 30%.
Empowering women has been a crucial part of our work. We formed self-help groups, conducted skill development workshops, and advocated for women's rights, fostering economic independence and confidence among women. Studies show that women’s economic empowerment can raise household incomes and spur economic development (The World Bank, 2018).
I am grateful to our mentor Devi Prasad Pandey Sir and supporters who guided us throughout this journey. Their wisdom and encouragement have been invaluable in our quest to create a brighter and more prosperous future for all.
Meghna Chaturvedi, School of Design, Roopayan
During my internship at Roopayan, I had the opportunity to create EVS lesson plans and discussion questions for primary school teachers and students. My focus was on integrating environmental education and addressing girl-child issues in class 3. Preparing these materials deepened my understanding of primary education, especially the principle of teaching from the known to the unknown, which emphasises building on students' existing knowledge.
Interacting with the children at the ashram, who, despite their challenging backgrounds, displayed joy and resilience, was both humbling and inspiring. Their happiness in the face of adversity made me reflect on my own privileges and the disparities many children face. Researching gender issues, including female infanticide and foeticide, highlighted the severe challenges girls encounter in India. This experience was an eye-opener, reinforcing my appreciation for the educational opportunities I have received and the support of my family.
The two-month internship was a profound learning journey, enhancing my empathy and commitment to advocating for educational equity and gender justice. I am grateful for the chance to contribute to these vital issues and plan to continue my involvement in social causes, applying the insights and skills gained during this period.
Vaibhav Balwant Singh
School of Computer Sciences
Child Help Foundation
Working with the Child Help Foundation to promote the Baby Feeding Centre (BFC) has been a deeply rewarding experience. My efforts to raise awareness about the BFC have significantly impacted the community, ensuring that mothers can travel with their babies without hesitation about feeding them. This initiative supports Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality, by empowering women to participate fully in public life without compromising their roles as caregivers.
The journey began when I learned about the difficulties many mothers faced in finding suitable places to feed their infants while in public. This often led to stress and discomfort, as public breastfeeding was met with disapproval and a lack of support. By promoting the BFC, more mothers are now aware of safe, comfortable spaces available for feeding their infants, which has led to increased confidence and ease for travelling mothers.
We organised street plays at two railway stations to raise public awareness about the importance of the Baby Feeding Centre across Mumbai and other parts of India. The impact of these efforts has been profound. Mothers now feel more confident and comfortable feeding their babies in public spaces, knowing there are dedicated areas for them. This shift has reduced the stigma around public breastfeeding and fostered a culture of support and acceptance. The availability of BFCs has alleviated the anxiety many mothers faced, allowing them to participate more fully in community activities and travel with ease.
Witnessing the appreciation and relief on the faces of mothers who utilise the BFC reassures me that our efforts are making a meaningful difference. This experience has reinforced my commitment to social service and motivated me to continue advocating for initiatives that support the well-being of society and advance gender equality.

SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Yash Kumar, UPES School of Computer Science, URVITA
During my Srijan Internship with Urvita (NGO), I had the privilege of working in the underdeveloped village of Konkandasa. Our primary focus was on the village's development, starting with a comprehensive survey to identify critical needs such as clean water, education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
One of our major initiatives was the installation of water filtration systems, which significantly improved access to clean drinking water and reduced waterborne diseases. We also established a community center that became a hub for educational and social activities, fostering unity and cooperation among the villagers. Additionally, we organised health camps to provide much-needed medical attention, addressing common health issues and promoting overall well-being.
The gratitude expressed by the villagers was deeply moving and reinforced the importance of our work. Witnessing the immediate positive changes in their lives was incredibly rewarding and motivated me to continue striving for social betterment.
This experience has profoundly impacted me personally. It has broadened my perspective on the challenges underdeveloped communities face and highlighted the importance of grassroots efforts. I have developed a greater sense of empathy and compassion and learned valuable lessons in humility and perseverance from the villagers' resilience.
Moreover, this internship enhanced my problem-solving and project-management skills as I navigated challenges and adapted to changing circumstances. The Srijan Internship at UPES with Urvita has been a transformative journey, both for the community and myself, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to society.
Aradhya Jindal, School of Advanced Engineering, Prerna Social Development and Welfare Society
For the past few months, I have been visiting a local village daily to work with students and engage in various activities aimed at empowering them. This experience has profoundly impacted both the community and my personal growth, transforming not just the lives of the students but also my understanding of what it means to be a compassionate and effective leader.
I performed various activities with the village children, such as teaching them dance and playing memory games, which helped them learn and play simultaneously. Other activities included planting trees as a step towards saving the environment, which benefited the community in some manner. The feeling of teaching and guiding students is incredibly beautiful. Interacting with them and seeing them understand things brings a different level of satisfaction. Their dedication and smiles motivated me to do better in the field.
One of the most significant changes I aimed to bring about was enhancing educational opportunities for the village children. Many students in the village lack access to quality educational resources and opportunities. To address this, I organised workshops focused on developing skills in English, mathematics, and science, as well as critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. By introducing creative teaching methods such as storytelling, interactive games, and project-based learning, I saw a noticeable improvement in the students’ engagement and enthusiasm for learning.
Beyond academics, a significant part of my work was dedicated to building students’ confidence. Many of these children had never been encouraged to express themselves or dream big. I conducted regular sessions on public speaking, art, and drama, encouraging them to share their thoughts and ideas. Witnessing their growth, from hesitant whispers to confident voices, was incredibly rewarding. Students began to express themselves more freely, contributing their ideas in group activities and showcasing their talents in community events.
In addition to these educational activities, I also focused on promoting clean water and sanitation practices within the community. We organised workshops to educate the villagers about the importance of clean water, proper sanitation, and hygiene practices. We installed water filters in schools and community centers to ensure access to safe drinking water. We also conducted cleanliness drives to improve sanitation facilities and reduce waterborne diseases. These efforts helped the community understand the significance of clean water and sanitation, leading to healthier and more sustainable living conditions.
This experience has profoundly impacted both the community and my personal growth. It has transformed not just the lives of the students but also my understanding of what it means to be a compassionate and effective leader. I have learned the value of empathy, patience, and perseverance. Working in challenging conditions and witnessing the daily struggles of these families has made me more appreciative of the opportunities I have had. It has also ignited a passion for social work and community service, inspiring me to continue contributing to similar causes in the future.
Through this internship, I have become a more compassionate and proactive individual, dedicated to making a positive difference in society. The smiles on the faces of the children and the gratitude of their parents are the most significant rewards of this journey, reminding me that even small efforts can lead to substantial changes in the lives of others.
Ananya Singh, UPES School of Computer Sciences, Bhawana Sewa Sansthan
At Bhawana Sewa Sansthan in Lucknow, my work has profoundly impacted both agricultural practices and water accessibility in rural communities. By introducing innovative farming techniques like organic methods and water-saving irrigation, we have significantly boosted crop yields and farmer incomes. This economic upliftment has empowered families to invest in education and health, fostering overall community growth.
Our involvement in the Jal Jeevan Mission has been transformative. By constructing and repairing wells, ponds, and other water bodies, we’ve ensured clean drinking water access, drastically improving health conditions and reducing water-borne diseases. This has also enhanced women’s and children’s quality of life, allowing them more time for productive activities and education.
Building strong relationships with the community has been crucial. Our farmer training sessions and water conservation efforts have not only addressed immediate needs but also empowered the community to take ownership of their development. Personally, this experience has deepened my empathy and problem-solving skills, reinforcing my commitment to sustainable practices and community-driven change. The satisfaction of witnessing tangible improvements in people’s lives and the environment is immeasurable.

We also established a community center that became a hub for educational and social activities, fostering unity and cooperation among the villagers. Additionally, we organised health camps to provide much-needed medical attention, addressing common health issues and promoting overall well-being.
The gratitude expressed by the villagers was deeply moving and reinforced the importance of our work. Witnessing the immediate positive changes in their lives was incredibly rewarding and motivated me to continue striving for social betterment.
This experience has profoundly impacted me personally. It has broadened my perspective on the challenges underdeveloped communities face and highlighted the importance of grassroots efforts. I have developed a greater sense of empathy and compassion and learned valuable lessons in humility and perseverance from the villagers' resilience.

SDG 10: Reduced Inequality: Reduce inequality within and among countries
Manshi K, UPES School of Law, HHFC Trust
I currently doing my social internship at Helping Hands Friends Charitable Trust(HHFC TRUST). I completed a survey with my fellow interns in three less-privileged areas of Patna. I prepared a comprehensive report for the organisation to take further actions for community betterment. The data revealed that over 70% of children in these areas lacked access to basic education and healthcare. This stark reality fueled our determination to make a difference.
Additionally, I developed a Campus Ambassador Program to engage students from various universities in social work, aiming to create a broader impact. Teaching different subjects to children in these areas was profoundly fulfilling. Initially, I hesitated to ask personal questions during our surveys in the slums of Boring Road, Patna. However, I gradually stepped out of my comfort zone, building confidence and improving my communication skills. This experience highlighted the importance of connecting with marginalised communities and reinforced the value of empathy and social responsibility in my professional journey. Research shows that social work significantly enhances soft skills, crucial for personal and professional development (Smith, 2018). Witnessing the children's enthusiasm and eagerness to learn was genuinely inspiring and confirmed the power of education and support.
Vishesh Singhal, UPES School of Computer Sciences, Arushi Society
My internship at Arushi Society has been profoundly transformative. At Arushi, dedicated to supporting disabled individuals, I engaged directly with those in need, assisting with daily activities, educational support, and providing a compassionate presence. This hands-on approach not only eased their daily challenges but also created a deep sense of connection and understanding.
A key aspect of my role involved converting textbooks into accessible audio files for visually impaired students and aiding in the occupational therapy unit and Down Syndrome classroom. These activities significantly enhanced the students' independence and confidence, allowing them to celebrate their progress and skills.
Interacting with students through activities like dance and music, and supporting them academically, was incredibly rewarding. Witnessing their growth and newfound confidence reinforced my commitment to disability rights and inclusion. My efforts contributed to creating a more inclusive environment and promoting a culture of empathy and respect.
This experience has deepened my empathy, patience, and dedication to advocating for the disabled community. It has shaped my personal and professional aspirations, inspiring me to work towards a society where everyone, regardless of ability, has the opportunity to thrive.
Angel Gupta, UPES School of Advanced Engineering, The Unforgotten Humanity Trust
During my time at the Srijan Social Internship Program at UPES, I embraced a modern and fresh approach to community service. My spontaneity and innovative mindset allowed me to benefit the community significantly. By adopting the philosophy of “smart work rather than hard work,” I was able to implement effective solutions that made a real difference.
One of my key contributions was using my knowledge to instill hope in those who had lost it. I guided individuals towards a respectful and fulfilling life, empowering them to become fighters and fearless in the face of life’s challenges. My efforts helped them stand up for themselves and navigate various odds with confidence.
Through this internship, I not only impacted the community but also grew as an individual, learning the importance of empathy, resilience, and smart work. This experience has been a cornerstone in my journey, shaping me into a more compassionate and effective leader.

Teaching different subjects to children in these areas was profoundly fulfilling. Initially, I hesitated to ask personal questions during our surveys in the slums of Boring Road, Patna. However, I gradually stepped out of my comfort zone, building confidence and improving my communication skills. This experience highlighted the importance of connecting with marginalised communities and reinforced the value of empathy and social responsibility in my professional journey. Research shows that social work significantly enhances soft skills, crucial for personal and professional development (Smith, 2018). Witnessing the children's enthusiasm and eagerness to learn was genuinely inspiring and confirmed the power of education and support.
Vishesh Singhal, UPES School of Computer Sciences, Arushi Society
My internship at Arushi Society has been profoundly transformative. At Arushi, dedicated to supporting disabled individuals, I engaged directly with those in need, assisting with daily activities, educational support, and providing a compassionate presence. This hands-on approach not only eased their daily challenges but also created a deep sense of connection and understanding.
A key aspect of my role involved converting textbooks into accessible audio files for visually impaired students and aiding in the occupational therapy unit and Down Syndrome classroom. These activities significantly enhanced the students' independence and confidence, allowing them to celebrate their progress and skills.
Interacting with students through activities like dance and music, and supporting them academically, was incredibly rewarding. Witnessing their growth and newfound confidence reinforced my commitment to disability rights and inclusion. My efforts contributed to creating a more inclusive environment and promoting a culture of empathy and respect.
This experience has deepened my empathy, patience, and dedication to advocating for the disabled community. It has shaped my personal and professional aspirations, inspiring me to work towards a society where everyone, regardless of ability, has the opportunity to thrive.

SDG 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels
Vidhiti Gaur, Dhruvh Social Awareness Forum School of Computer Science
Working at DHRUVH SOCIAL AWARENESS FORUM, focused on combating human trafficking, has been one of the most fulfiling experiences of my life. My work has directly contributed to the well-being and empowerment of survivors, providing them with the resources and support necessary to rebuild their lives.
One of the primary roles I've played is in the rescue and rehabilitation of trafficking victims. Collaborating with law enforcement and other organisations has rescued numerous individuals from exploitative situations. The rehabilitation process includes providing safe shelter, medical care, psychological support, and legal assistance, which are crucial for their recovery and reintegration into society. By fostering partnerships with local businesses, schools, and healthcare providers, we have created a support system that offers ongoing assistance to survivors, ensuring they access necessary resources as they transition back into normal life.
Working in an NGO that combats human trafficking has been an incredibly rewarding yet challenging experience. Witnessing the resilience and courage of survivors as they reclaim their lives is profoundly inspiring. Each success story reaffirms the importance of our work and motivates me to continue pushing forward despite the challenges. The emotional toll of working with trafficking survivors cannot be understated. Hearing their stories of trauma and exploitation can be heart-wrenching, but it also underscores the critical nature of our mission. The bonds formed with survivors and the gratitude expressed by them are deeply humbling and serve as a constant reminder of why this work matters.
One of the most significant changes we've brought about is heightened awareness regarding human trafficking. By organising awareness campaigns, educational workshops, and community outreach programs, we have educated thousands about the signs of trafficking, the importance of vigilance, and how to report suspicious activities.
My work at the NGO has not only benefited the community by rescuing and empowering trafficking survivors but has also profoundly impacted me personally. The journey is ongoing, and I remain committed to fighting human trafficking and supporting survivors as they rebuild their lives.
Anika Agarwal, UPES School of Law, Nyaybodh Foundation
Anika Agarwal, a second-year BA LLB Hons student at UPES Dehradun. This summer, I interned at the Nyayabodh Foundation, where I explored the intersection of law and social justice. This experience significantly broadened my understanding of how legal frameworks can drive societal change.
Under the mentorship of Adv. Ritika Raj, I delved into crucial legal concepts and case studies, particularly focusing on women's rights. I engaged with landmark cases and laws such as the Domestic Violence Act and the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act. This hands-on experience demonstrated the transformative power of legal protections and highlighted the real-world impact of these laws.
One memorable project involved working on a case where a woman received legal protection after experiencing domestic violence. This case underscored the vital role of legal awareness in empowering individuals and ensuring justice. Additionally, conducting legal awareness workshops in various communities revealed the gap between legal knowledge and its accessibility, reinforcing the need for widespread education about legal rights.
This internship has profoundly shaped my career aspirations, reinforcing my commitment to a legal career focused on social justice. It has shown me the potential of law to effect positive change and inspired me to advocate for accessible justice.
Manya Goyel, UPES School of Business, Aagaas Federation
During my internship with Aagaas Federation, I engaged in projects that directly contributed to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. My work focused on promoting socio-economic development, environmental sustainability, and community empowerment, highlighting the interconnectedness of these elements in fostering peaceful and just societies.
One of the key aspects of my internship was raising awareness about the links between socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. I organised workshops and advocacy campaigns to educate community members about the importance of sustainable practices and their impact on social equity. By highlighting how environmental health and socio-economic progress are interrelated, we fostered a deeper understanding of how these issues contribute to peace and justice in our communities.
I actively participated in local volunteer initiatives, applying practical skills acquired during my internship to support community development. Through organizing events and providing hands-on assistance, I contributed to building a more inclusive and resilient community. This experience underscored the value of grassroots efforts in promoting social justice and strengthening institutional capacity.
My work also involved collaborating with local organisations to enhance their effectiveness and inclusivity. By offering support and resources, we helped these institutions better serve their communities and address pressing issues related to peace, justice, and sustainability. This experience reinforced the importance of strong, accountable institutions in achieving long-term social impact.

The bonds formed with survivors and the gratitude expressed by them are deeply humbling and serve as a constant reminder of why this work matters.
One of the most significant changes we've brought about is heightened awareness regarding human trafficking. By organising awareness campaigns, educational workshops, and community outreach programs, we have educated thousands about the signs of trafficking, the importance of vigilance, and how to report suspicious activities.
My work at the NGO has not only benefited the community by rescuing and empowering trafficking survivors but has also profoundly impacted me personally. The journey is ongoing, and I remain committed to fighting human trafficking and supporting survivors as they rebuild their lives.
Anika Agarwal, UPES School of Law, Nyaybodh Foundation
Anika Agarwal, a second-year BA LLB Hons student at UPES Dehradun. This summer, I interned at the Nyayabodh Foundation, where I explored the intersection of law and social justice. This experience significantly broadened my understanding of how legal frameworks can drive societal change.
Under the mentorship of Adv. Ritika Raj, I delved into crucial legal concepts and case studies, particularly focusing on women's rights. I engaged with landmark cases and laws such as the Domestic Violence Act and the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act. This hands-on experience demonstrated the transformative power of legal protections and highlighted the real-world impact of these laws.
One memorable project involved working on a case where a woman received legal protection after experiencing domestic violence. This case underscored the vital role of legal awareness in empowering individuals and ensuring justice. Additionally, conducting legal awareness workshops in various communities revealed the gap between legal knowledge and its accessibility, reinforcing the need for widespread education about legal rights.
This internship has profoundly shaped my career aspirations, reinforcing my commitment to a legal career focused on social justice. It has shown me the potential of law to effect positive change and inspired me to advocate for accessible justice.
Manya Goyel, UPES School of Business, Aagaas Federation
During my internship with Aagaas Federation, I engaged in projects that directly contributed to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. My work focused on promoting socio-economic development, environmental sustainability, and community empowerment, highlighting the interconnectedness of these elements in fostering peaceful and just societies.
One of the key aspects of my internship was raising awareness about the links between socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. I organised workshops and advocacy campaigns to educate community members about the importance of sustainable practices and their impact on social equity. By highlighting how environmental health and socio-economic progress are interrelated, we fostered a deeper understanding of how these issues contribute to peace and justice in our communities.
I actively participated in local volunteer initiatives, applying practical skills acquired during my internship to support community development. Through organizing events and providing hands-on assistance, I contributed to building a more inclusive and resilient community. This experience underscored the value of grassroots efforts in promoting social justice and strengthening institutional capacity.
My work also involved collaborating with local organisations to enhance their effectiveness and inclusivity. By offering support and resources, we helped these institutions better serve their communities and address pressing issues related to peace, justice, and sustainability. This experience reinforced the importance of strong, accountable institutions in achieving long-term social impact.

Vidhiti Gaur, Dhruvh Social Awareness Forum School of Computer Science

Working at DHRUVH SOCIAL AWARENESS FORUM, focused on combating human trafficking, has been one of the most fulfiling experiences of my life. My work has directly contributed to the well-being and empowerment of survivors, providing them with the resources and support necessary to rebuild their lives.
One of the primary roles I've played is in the rescue and rehabilitation of trafficking victims. Collaborating with law enforcement and other organisations has rescued numerous individuals from exploitative situations. The rehabilitation process includes providing safe shelter, medical care, psychological support, and legal assistance, which are crucial for their recovery and reintegration into society. By fostering partnerships with local businesses, schools, and healthcare providers, we have created a support system that offers ongoing assistance to survivors, ensuring they access necessary resources as they transition back into normal life.
Working in an NGO that combats human trafficking has been an incredibly rewarding yet challenging experience. Witnessing the resilience and courage of survivors as they reclaim their lives is profoundly inspiring. Each success story reaffirms the importance of our work and motivates me to continue pushing forward despite the challenges. The emotional toll of working with trafficking survivors cannot be understated. Hearing their stories of trauma and exploitation can be heart-wrenching, but it also underscores the critical nature of our mission.

AMANNA AGGARWAL, UPES School of Business,  Hope for animals rescue shelter
During my time volunteering at Hope for Animals Rescue Shelter, I played a significant role in fostering collaboration and building partnerships that had a profound impact on our community. By working closely with local businesses, NGOs, and government bodies, we enhanced our ability to rescue and care for animals, organise effective adoption drives, and implement educational programs. Our efforts in hosting public events and fundraising activities created valuable opportunities for community engagement, bringing together diverse groups and supporting local entrepreneurship. Educational outreach programs, particularly in schools, helped instill a sense of responsibility and empathy in young students, fostering a compassionate future generation. Additionally, our focus on disaster preparedness and relief ensured that we could respond swiftly and effectively to animal needs during emergencies. By promoting sustainable practices, such as sterilisation and health programs, we contributed to improving public health and controlling the stray animal population. This experience not only strengthened my leadership skills and deepened my empathy but also demonstrated the power of collaborative efforts in creating meaningful change. The collective impact of our work highlighted the importance of partnerships in advancing community well-being and supporting sustainable development.

Reet Varshney, School of Computer Sciences:
My internship with Saambhavi in Delhi was transformative. Engaging in diverse activities, from teaching underprivileged children to planting saplings, enriched my understanding and empathy. I learned the power of education, the joy of simplicity, and the strength of the human spirit. This experience deepened my connection to the community and inspired me to continue working towards positive change, both personally and professionally.
Sanyam Dhingra, School of Computer Sciences:
My internship with Divya Prem Seva Mission was profoundly fulfilling. I gained invaluable knowledge about meditation and the importance of helping the needy in slum areas. This experience deepened my empathy and inspired me to start helping labourers near my home.
