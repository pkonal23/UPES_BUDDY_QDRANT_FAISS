Program Details
The
B.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
offered by UPES School of Design is a comprehensive undergraduate program that provides students with an exceptional opportunity to explore the latest technology and innovations in the field. By utilizing state-of-the-art facilities such as the High-Performance Visualization Lab and the Rapid Product Development Lab, students are equipped with the necessary tools to develop expertise in designing cutting-edge mobility solutions that serve unique functions and hold social significance.
The
B.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
program acknowledges this fact and prepares students to address the challenges and demands of a dynamic society. Design considerations extend beyond technical aspects, encompassing cultural and socio-economic sensitivities. Specialized areas of growth within the program include vehicle exteriors, interiors (including user interface and experience), and alternative modes of transportation like personal mobility, public transit systems, 2-wheelers, and watercraft vehicles.
Graduates of this program emerge as proficient auto designers, capable of making their mark both in India and on an international stage. They are equipped with the necessary creativity and skills to design forward-thinking mobility solutions that tackle transportation issues for both public and personal use. This involves creating vehicles with unique personalities, enhanced functionality, and positive social impact. The field of transportation and mobility design is inherently multidisciplinary, merging the digital and physical realms.
Program Highlights
B.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
students benefit from unparalleled infrastructure, including cutting-edge labs equipped with Cintiq, Mac, CAD, clay modelling and FRP, a wood workshop, 3D printer, and VR technology, providing a conducive environment for learning and innovation.
Gain exposure to industry-standard design software used extensively across various disciplines, enabling you to develop essential graphic design skills and effectively utilize these tools in your professional journey.
Engage in collaborative partnerships with renowned mobility and transportation companies, such as Maruti Suzuki, Hero Motor Corp., TVS Motors, Volvo, Kia Motors, Bajaj Auto, Ola Motors, Cyient Technology, Tata Elxsi, Eicher Motors, and Royal Enfield, allowing you to undergo training programs and gain practical knowledge directly from industry experts.
Through a series of lectures, discussions, exercises, and assignments, acquire the fundamental knowledge and skills required for a successful entry into the professional world of transportation and mobility design.
B.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
students benefit from the opportunity to work with well-established companies in the industry, providing invaluable practical exposure and allowing them to apply theoretical concepts to real-world design challenges.
Stay at the forefront of industry trends with a particular emphasis on electric vehicles (EVs), as demonstrated by collaborations with companies like Tata Elxsi Hyderabad, Eicher Motors Chennai, and Bangalore-based Ola Motors and Cyient Technology, preparing you for the future of sustainable transportation design.
Future Scope / Industry Trends
The future scope of a
B.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
program is promising and dynamic. In the modern era, transportation has evolved beyond mere conveyance, and the industry now demands skilled design experts who can create solutions that cater to present and future needs while considering technical complexities and aesthetics. The sector offers numerous career prospects due to innovative concepts and advanced technologies. A degree in this field is essential, as it provides the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in the rapidly expanding mobility industry. Cloud-based systems and software-as-a-service (SaaS) models have become integral to the transportation industry, enabling scalability and innovative digital resource utilization. The rise of mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) emphasizes the need for convenient and hassle-free travel experiences. Integrated travel and transport have become a significant trend, driven by infrastructure optimization, ticketless travel platforms, mobility hubs for multimodal transportation, and innovations in last-mile connectivity and micro-mobility.
