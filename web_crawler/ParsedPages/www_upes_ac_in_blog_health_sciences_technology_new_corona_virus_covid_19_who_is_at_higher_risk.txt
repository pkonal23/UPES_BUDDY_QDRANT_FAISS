New Corona Virus (COVID-19): Who is at higher risk?
Deepanmol Singh
Published 18/03/2020
Although WHO states that people of all ages can be infected by New Corona Virus (2019-nCOV), a certain section of the population is more vulnerable. It includes:
1. People 65 years and older
2. People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
3. People of any age with the following underlying medical conditions, particularly those that are not well controlled
Chronic lung disease or asthma
Congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease
Diabetes
Neurologic conditions that weaken ability to cough
Weakened immune system
Chemotherapy or radiation for cancer (currently or in recent past)
Sickle cell anemia
Chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis
Cirrhosis of the liver
Lack of spleen or a spleen that doesn’t function correctly
Extreme obesity (body mass index [BMI] >40)
4. People who are pregnant*. *Present data shows that there is no maternal-fetal transmission of COVID 19.
Indian Mortality Status:
In India, death was reported in a 76-year-old male from Karnataka and 68-year-old female from Delhi, and 63-year old man from Maharashtra all three with co-morbidities.
Data shows the correlation of Age and % Case Fatality Rate in China

Case of South Korea and Italy:
Both countries have high number of patients positively diagnosed with COVID-19, but in Italy percentage fatality rate is higher as 90% of deaths occur in those 70 years or older. On the other hand, in South Korea, the percentage fatality rate is significantly low as most of the positively diagnosed population is young (less than 40 years).
The pandemic is gender agnostic throughout the world. However, the morbidity rates are higher in men as compared to women.

14.8
Case of South Korea and Italy:
Both countries have high number of patients positively diagnosed with COVID-19, but in Italy percentage fatality rate is higher as 90% of deaths occur in those 70 years or older. On the other hand, in South Korea, the percentage fatality rate is significantly low as most of the positively diagnosed population is young (less than 40 years).
The pandemic is gender agnostic throughout the world. However, the morbidity rates are higher in men as compared to women.

New Corona Virus (COVID-19): Who is at higher risk?
Deepanmol Singh
Published 18/03/2020
Although WHO states that people of all ages can be infected by New Corona Virus (2019-nCOV), a certain section of the population is more vulnerable. It includes:
1. People 65 years and older
2. People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
3. People of any age with the following underlying medical conditions, particularly those that are not well controlled
Chronic lung disease or asthma
Congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease
Diabetes
Neurologic conditions that weaken ability to cough
Weakened immune system
Chemotherapy or radiation for cancer (currently or in recent past)
Sickle cell anemia
Chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis
Cirrhosis of the liver
Lack of spleen or a spleen that doesn’t function correctly
Extreme obesity (body mass index [BMI] >40)
4. People who are pregnant*. *Present data shows that there is no maternal-fetal transmission of COVID 19.
Indian Mortality Status:
In India, death was reported in a 76-year-old male from Karnataka and 68-year-old female from Delhi, and 63-year old man from Maharashtra all three with co-morbidities.
