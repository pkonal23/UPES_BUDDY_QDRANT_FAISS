Program Details
BA (Honours) English is an exciting opportunity to study the vast expanse of literature and literary developments from the Old English period to the present. The programme is designed to engage with poetry, prose, drama, manga, and various alternative forms of text. The curriculum engages with questions of literary production, textual tradition, and critical theory.
Our transdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning encourages students to integrate knowledge from across academic domains prompting them to work towards solving multifaceted global problems. Core disciplinary knowledge is integrated with theoretical approaches from a variety of disciplines to allow for a more nuanced understanding of texts.
Some of our transdisciplinary research areas include Gender Studies, Digital Humanities, Death Studies, Race and Postcolonial Theory, and Popular Culture Studies.
The fundamental strength of our programme is the ability to read and understand texts as a medium to study the human condition. The programme, therefore, seeks to direct the course of literary learning towards addressing socio-political, historical, cultural, and environmental concerns to foster a more inclusive, just, and sustainable future.
Along with a range of core papers, students can choose from a pool of fascinating electives to graduate. The curriculum is aimed at creating a strong academic foundation in conjunction with experiential training through community connect, internships and fellowships. Students are trained in transferable skills—analytical, critical thinking, creative and incisive writing, research—preparing them towards their career goals.
Our faculty members trained at some of the best national and international universities such as Aligarh Muslim University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, EFL University, Cardiff University, University of Notre Dame, Macquarie University, and University of California, Berkeley are dedicated to working closely with students, encouraging them to think critically and creatively about real-world challenges.
At the School of Liberal Studies and Media, we are devoted to a transdisciplinary approach to learning. Film screenings-cum-readings, research seminars by faculty, lecture series and master classes by globally renowned academicians, workshops and conferences are directed towards that very purpose.
For the holistic development of students, we also encourage students to participate in various curricular and extracurricular opportunities on and off campus.
Our programme will help students:
Express ideas and thoughts incisively and critically.
Develop a nuanced understanding of the world through the medium of letters (literature).
Deliberate on socio-political, and artistic contexts of literary production cross-temporally and cross-spatially.
Examine the intricacies of cultural, social, and historical milieu through literary and artistic expressions.
Reflect critically on questions of marginality, intersectionality, and exclusion, therein, taking up issues of class, caste, creed, gender etc.
Program Highlights
The programme follows the four-year (3+1) structure which allows a three-year undergraduate study combined with the opportunity to undertake an additional fourth year of research-driven study in English.
Students experience a transdisciplinary approach to learning which involves film screenings, research seminars, guest talks, workshops, and learning through critical reflections.
Students learn to appreciate literature’s liaisons with other academic domains such as history, politics, and cultural studies.
Students learn from globally renowned academicians, researchers, and thinkers.
Students have the opportunity to study at some of the most renowned global universities as part of our student exchange programmes.
Experiential learning both within and outside the classroom.
Graduates develop applied skills through fellowships, internships, and field visits.
Graduates develop transferable skills—written and verbal communication skills, analytical skills, and strong research skills—that are immensely sought after in the industry.
Professionals from the team of Career Services help students plan for their careers.
Future Scope / Industry Trends
Employers are looking to hire individuals who are well-rounded and who exhibit a capacity to communicate clearly, to think creatively and critically, and to empathetically address workplace concerns. The BA (Honours) in English programme has been developed keeping in mind the changing needs of the industry.

Program Details
BA (Honours) English is an exciting opportunity to study the vast expanse of literature and literary developments from the Old English period to the present. The programme is designed to engage with poetry, prose, drama, manga, and various alternative forms of text. The curriculum engages with questions of literary production, textual tradition, and critical theory.
Our transdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning encourages students to integrate knowledge from across academic domains prompting them to work towards solving multifaceted global problems. Core disciplinary knowledge is integrated with theoretical approaches from a variety of disciplines to allow for a more nuanced understanding of texts.
Some of our transdisciplinary research areas include Gender Studies, Digital Humanities, Death Studies, Race and Postcolonial Theory, and Popular Culture Studies.
The fundamental strength of our programme is the ability to read and understand texts as a medium to study the human condition. The programme, therefore, seeks to direct the course of literary learning towards addressing socio-political, historical, cultural, and environmental concerns to foster a more inclusive, just, and sustainable future.
Along with a range of core papers, students can choose from a pool of fascinating electives to graduate. The curriculum is aimed at creating a strong academic foundation in conjunction with experiential training through community connect, internships and fellowships. Students are trained in transferable skills—analytical, critical thinking, creative and incisive writing, research—preparing them towards their career goals.
Our faculty members trained at some of the best national and international universities such as Aligarh Muslim University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, EFL University, Cardiff University, University of Notre Dame, Macquarie University, and University of California, Berkeley are dedicated to working closely with students, encouraging them to think critically and creatively about real-world challenges.
At the School of Liberal Studies and Media, we are devoted to a transdisciplinary approach to learning. Film screenings-cum-readings, research seminars by faculty, lecture series and master classes by globally renowned academicians, workshops and conferences are directed towards that very purpose.
For the holistic development of students, we also encourage students to participate in various curricular and extracurricular opportunities on and off campus.
Our programme will help students:
Express ideas and thoughts incisively and critically.
Develop a nuanced understanding of the world through the medium of letters (literature).
Deliberate on socio-political, and artistic contexts of literary production cross-temporally and cross-spatially.
Examine the intricacies of cultural, social, and historical milieu through literary and artistic expressions.

Students experience a transdisciplinary approach to learning which involves film screenings, research seminars, guest talks, workshops, and learning through critical reflections.

At the School of Liberal Studies and Media, we are devoted to a transdisciplinary approach to learning. Film screenings-cum-readings, research seminars by faculty, lecture series and master classes by globally renowned academicians, workshops and conferences are directed towards that very purpose.
For the holistic development of students, we also encourage students to participate in various curricular and extracurricular opportunities on and off campus.
Our programme will help students:
Express ideas and thoughts incisively and critically.
Develop a nuanced understanding of the world through the medium of letters (literature).
Deliberate on socio-political, and artistic contexts of literary production cross-temporally and cross-spatially.
Examine the intricacies of cultural, social, and historical milieu through literary and artistic expressions.
Reflect critically on questions of marginality, intersectionality, and exclusion, therein, taking up issues of class, caste, creed, gender etc.

BA (Honours) English is an exciting opportunity to study the vast expanse of literature and literary developments from the Old English period to the present. The programme is designed to engage with poetry, prose, drama, manga, and various alternative forms of text. The curriculum engages with questions of literary production, textual tradition, and critical theory.

Our transdisciplinary approach to teaching and learning encourages students to integrate knowledge from across academic domains prompting them to work towards solving multifaceted global problems. Core disciplinary knowledge is integrated with theoretical approaches from a variety of disciplines to allow for a more nuanced understanding of texts.

Some of our transdisciplinary research areas include Gender Studies, Digital Humanities, Death Studies, Race and Postcolonial Theory, and Popular Culture Studies.

The fundamental strength of our programme is the ability to read and understand texts as a medium to study the human condition. The programme, therefore, seeks to direct the course of literary learning towards addressing socio-political, historical, cultural, and environmental concerns to foster a more inclusive, just, and sustainable future.

Along with a range of core papers, students can choose from a pool of fascinating electives to graduate. The curriculum is aimed at creating a strong academic foundation in conjunction with experiential training through community connect, internships and fellowships. Students are trained in transferable skills—analytical, critical thinking, creative and incisive writing, research—preparing them towards their career goals.
