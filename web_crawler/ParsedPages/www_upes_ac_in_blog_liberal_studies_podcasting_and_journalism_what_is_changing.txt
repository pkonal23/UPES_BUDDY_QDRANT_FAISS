Podcasting: The New Frontier in Journalism
UPES Editorial Team
Published 26/09/2024
India has rapidly emerged as a major player in the
podcasting
world, ranking third globally—just behind the USA and China. With an estimated 150 million Indians tuning in to audio streaming platforms, the country is experiencing an audio revolution. This surge in listenership signals a massive growth opportunity for the podcasting industry in India, as audiences across the country embrace the convenience and diversity of on-demand audio content.
As more creators and platforms tap into this expanding market, podcasting in India is set to skyrocket, offering endless possibilities for storytelling, education, and entertainment. Here’s a Blog to help you understand the emerging field of podcasting. Who knows you might be the next emerging podcaster!
What is Podcasting?
At its core, a podcast is an audio program, often distributed in episodes, that can be streamed or downloaded from the internet. Unlike traditional radio broadcasts, podcasts are not bound by a specific time slot or frequency, offering both creators and listeners flexibility. Podcasts can cover a wide range of topics, from entertainment to education, with many now focusing on news, investigative journalism, and in-depth analysis.
The surge in podcast popularity is evident, with millions of people tuning in to listen to their favorite shows regularly. This rise has transformed podcasting from a niche hobby into a mainstream media format, especially within the world of journalism.
What Makes Podcasting Unique?
It's incredibly accessible. Listeners can tune in whenever they want.
Podcasts are ideal for
long-form storytelling and in-depth reporting.
It is a good source of investigative journalism.
Podcasts also create a sense of intimacy, as listeners feel like they’re being spoken to directly.
Why Should One Choose a Career in Podcasting?
Depending on variables like audience size, advertising revenue, sponsorships, and the particular monetization model they use, podcasters in India may make a wide range of potential salaries.
Nonetheless, a few broad patterns emerge:
A mix of advertising, sponsorships, and other forms of monetization can bring in a few hundred thousand to several million rupees a year for well-established podcasters with a sizable, active fan base.
Prominent Indian podcasters have disclosed yearly earnings ranging from 1 to 5 crore INR. Earnings for smaller or more recent podcasts are typically lower, typically ranging from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand rupees annually. Instead of typical advertising money, these podcasters might rely more on affiliate marketing, crowdsourcing, or direct assistance from their listeners.
As the Indian podcasting scene is still in its infancy when compared to more developed markets, revenue potential can be highly erratic and contingent upon each podcast's capacity to expand its listenership and forge profitable alliances. For podcasters hoping to turn their hobby into a viable full-time business in India, consistent, long-term growth is essential.
The Role of Podcasts in Modern Journalism
In the modern media landscape, podcasts play a crucial role in shaping public discourse and delivering news. Podcasts provide an outlet for diverse voices, offering independent journalists and experts a platform to share perspectives that may not receive coverage in mainstream outlets. This has led to a rich variety of content, covering everything from global politics to hyper-local issues.
To deepen your understanding of the podcasting world, consider adding a journalism degree to your skillset. After Class 12, students have the option to pursue various degree or diploma programs in mass communication that can enhance their podcasting expertise. Popular Journalism specializations include
BA-JMC (BA Journalism and Mass Communication - Digital)
and
BA-DDM (BA Digital and Mass Media - Broadcasting)
, both of which provide valuable insights into digital media, broadcasting, and storytelling—key skills for excelling in podcasting.
Challenges and Opportunities in Podcast Journalism
It’s advisable to always research something well before jumping into it, thinking it’s all gold and diamonds. As we all know everything comes with its challenges, here’s a list of some significant hurdles one faces in the podcasting journey:
Monetization
Credibility
Finding your niche
Copyright issue
Content consistency
Audience engagement
Distribution
Whether it's amplifying diverse voices, offering in-depth reporting, or experimenting with new formats, podcasting is more than just a trend—it’s the new frontier of journalism. As the medium continues to evolve, it’s clear that podcasting will play a crucial role in shaping the future of how we consume news and information.
The Future of Podcasting in Journalism
The future of podcasting in journalism looks promising. As listeners continue to crave authentic, engaging content, podcasts are likely to become a primary news source for many. We can expect further integration with other digital platforms, such as social media, video content, and even interactive experiences like live podcasting events.
In addition, as AI and other technological advancements emerge, podcast production could become more sophisticated, enhancing both the storytelling and the listener experience. This could pave the way for even more journalistic experimentation, leading to new and innovative ways of delivering the news.
Conclusion
Podcasting has redefined how journalism is produced and consumed. Its unique blend of accessibility, intimacy, and long-form storytelling has made it a powerful tool for delivering news in today’s digital landscape. Whether it's amplifying diverse voices, offering in-depth reporting, or experimenting with new formats, podcasting is more than just a trend—it’s the new frontier of journalism. As the medium continues to evolve, it’s clear that podcasting will play a crucial role in shaping the future of how we consume news and information.
Call to Action:
If you're passionate about journalism, now is the perfect time to explore the world of podcasting. Whether you want to stay informed or create your podcast, there are endless resources and opportunities available to get started in this exciting new frontier.

Nonetheless, a few broad patterns emerge:
A mix of advertising, sponsorships, and other forms of monetization can bring in a few hundred thousand to several million rupees a year for well-established podcasters with a sizable, active fan base.
Prominent Indian podcasters have disclosed yearly earnings ranging from 1 to 5 crore INR. Earnings for smaller or more recent podcasts are typically lower, typically ranging from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand rupees annually. Instead of typical advertising money, these podcasters might rely more on affiliate marketing, crowdsourcing, or direct assistance from their listeners.
As the Indian podcasting scene is still in its infancy when compared to more developed markets, revenue potential can be highly erratic and contingent upon each podcast's capacity to expand its listenership and forge profitable alliances. For podcasters hoping to turn their hobby into a viable full-time business in India, consistent, long-term growth is essential.
The Role of Podcasts in Modern Journalism

To deepen your understanding of the podcasting world, consider adding a journalism degree to your skillset. After Class 12, students have the option to pursue various degree or diploma programs in mass communication that can enhance their podcasting expertise. Popular Journalism specializations include
BA-JMC (BA Journalism and Mass Communication - Digital)
and
BA-DDM (BA Digital and Mass Media - Broadcasting)
