Dr. Prabhat Ranjan Singh

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Prabhat Ranjan Singh is a globally recognized expert in swarm intelligence, with a distinguished career that spans multiple facets of artificial intelligence and computational modeling. His research is primarily focused on optimization techniques, advanced network technology, and natural language processing, specifically exploring the dynamic interconnections among energy transition, technology levels, and economic development under the umbrella of economic globalization. His work significantly advances the field of engineering problem optimization and introduces innovative adaptive network technologies. Recently, Dr. Prabhat has also directed his expertise towards enhancing functionalities of conversational AI systems like ChatGPT. His contributions are not only pivotal in academic circles but also instrumental in shaping practical applications that address real-world challenges across industries. Through his research, Dr. Prabhat aims to create systems that are not only technologically advanced but also socially and economically impactful.
Work Experience
Before his tenure at UPES, Dr. Prabhat held an Assistant Professor position at the Amity Institute of Information Technology, Amity University Patna, where he contributed to both teaching and research in information technology. Prior to that, he served as a Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at Banaras Hindu University, India. In this role, Dr. Prabhat engaged in advanced research projects, further honing his expertise in computer science and contributing significantly to the academic community through his scholarly work.
Research Interests
Swarm Intelligence I Optimization I Machine Learning I Natural Language Processing
Dr. Prabhat's research interests lie at the intersection of swarm intelligence algorithms and deep learning, focusing on enhancing the adaptability of NLP and conversational AI in dynamic environments. He is particularly interested in utilizing swarm intelligence to detect and mitigate biases within large language models. His future research aims to explore decentralized methods for continuously monitoring, evaluating, and correcting biases in conversational AI systems. Additionally, he is investigating how principles of swarm intelligence can be applied to model language evolution and learning processes in conversational AI, pushing the boundaries of how machines understand and interact using natural language.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Prabhat's teaching philosophy is centered on fostering an educational environment that actively supports and encourages student engagement and learning. He believes in his responsibility to create a nurturing learning atmosphere and has adopted innovative teaching methods. This approach involves pre-reading assignments that prepare students for quizzes at the beginning of each class, focusing on real applications rather than mere theoretical discussions. The quiz content serves as a foundation for in-class activities that involve real data and authentic problems, thus facilitating a deeper understanding and helping students transition from novice to expert thinkers in their field.
Courses Taught
Dr. Prabhat is a seasoned educator in the field of computer science, teaching a diverse range of courses tailored to both theoretical and practical aspects of technology. His teaching portfolio includes advanced topics such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, as well as industry-relevant courses like Open Source Systems for Industries. He also imparts knowledge in the Java programming language, aligning with core software development practices. Recently, his curriculum has expanded to include Web Technology and courses on IT Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery, preparing students to tackle real-world challenges in the tech landscape.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Prabhat received the Ph.D. from Wuhan University of Technology under the MOFCOM scholarship.
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Prabhat is a distinguished figure in the field of artificial intelligence, known for his innovative contributions and collaborative efforts on an international scale. His scholarly work includes several high-impact publications in reputable journals such as Expert Systems with Applications, Applied Soft Computing, Energy Reports, and IEEE journal. Dr. Prabhat has spearheaded numerous multidisciplinary teams in groundbreaking research that focuses not only on theoretical advancements but also on practical applications and their impact on society.
A notable project led by Dr. Prabhat involved the development of Improved Spider Monkey Optimization. This research mimicked and enhanced the foraging behaviours of spider monkeys through sophisticated mathematical algorithms, presenting a novel approach to optimization problems. Another significant contribution is his work on ludo game-based swarm intelligence, which applies the strategic insights gained from ludo players to enhance algorithmic performance, demonstrating a creative intersection of traditional games and computational techniques.
Furthermore, Dr. Prabhat has collaborated extensively to address key issues in cloud computing, such as reducing energy consumption and minimizing Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. His work also extends into economic models that dynamically link energy transition, technological advancement, and economic development, reflecting his commitment to addressing global challenges through a multidisciplinary lens.
