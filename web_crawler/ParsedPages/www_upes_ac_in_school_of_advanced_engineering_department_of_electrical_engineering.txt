About the Department
The Electrical and Electronics Engineering department was established in the year 2008. Presently, it offers two undergraduate programs – B.Tech. in Electronics & Computer Engineering and B. Tech. in Electrical Engineering, and one postgraduate program –  M. Tech. in Robotics Engineering.
The department aims to get students industry ready to be able to address and tackle the challenge of the new phase of the Industrial Revolution.
As problems of this age get more complex, it's important that students are well-versed in subjects like AI and ML, Communication, VLSI, E-Vehicles, self-driving cars, internet of things, renewable energy, and robotics to name a few.
In order to facilitate their learning, they are given an additional option to choose a specialisation to cater to the specialised skillset demanded by the industry today. The specialisations offered by the department  for the two undergraduate programs are AI and ML applications, Wearable Devices, Microelectronics, 5G & 6G technology, and Industrial Drives. The department also offers Ph.D programs in Electrical Engineering and Electronics Engineering.
Apart from this, the department is focussed on providing:
Our curriculum maintains its focus on traditional engineering while also allowing for learning with cutting-edge technology. Furthermore, specialised courses cover the areas of AI and ML, Embedded Systems, IoT, Robotics, Drives and many more. A hands-on approach is given priority with project-based learning, and life skills courses that ensure a well-rounded holistic education that creates responsible, ethical engineers to benefit society.
