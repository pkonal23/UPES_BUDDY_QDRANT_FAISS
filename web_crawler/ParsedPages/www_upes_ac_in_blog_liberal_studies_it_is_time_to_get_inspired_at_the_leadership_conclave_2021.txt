It is time to get inspired at the ‘Leadership Conclave’ 2021
Ekta Kashyap
Published 09/08/2021
(L-R) UPES students Disha Tripathi and Anmol Singhal, lead organizers of ‘The Leadership Conclave 2021’
The two-day event, being organised by student team ‘Fearless Falcons’, will be held on August 28-29 and will feature prominent leaders and students from across the country
Since the inception of the
UPES School for Life
– an institution that nurtures students to develop comprehensive skills for personal and professional success – several students have undertaken projects with the intent to create a profound impact in the world around them.
That these change-makers are so young only makes their passion to lead much more impressive. At a time when the global problems are on a surge, it is essential – and refreshing – to see Generation Z take charge.
‘Fearless Falcons’ is one such cohort of students who are helping the youth to ‘find their fire’. Led by UPES students Anmol Singhal and Disha Tripathi, the team is organising a ‘Leadership Conclave’ under the banner of School for Life. The team members working for the event include Aditya Pilani, Aryan Deopa, Ayush Patidar, Falguni Soni, Hinika Shail, Vagisha Khandelwal, Mrittika Bajaj, Himali and Harsh Baranwal.
The virtual seminar will be held on August 28-29, 2021, and will witness the participation of eminent leaders and students from across the country. The recorded sessions will be premiered on the
Fearless Falcons’ YouTube channel
.
Detailing the schedule of the conclave, Team Lead Anmol, who is studying
Computer Science and Engineering
with a specialisation in AI and ML, says, “Day 1 will feature several prominent guest speakers who will discuss their insights on leadership; on day 2, a variety of meaningful activities will take place. For the event, we are receiving registrations from students of various institutions such as BITS Pilani and Indian Institute of Management.”
Activities on Day 2 include:
1. Stock Triumph:
A combination of fate, skill and strategy, ‘The Stock Triumph,’ is a game based on the stock marketplace that will allow students to put their talents to the test using news flashes and real-time data.
2. Pitch Arena:
Students will present their business model/start-up idea and let the audience scrutinize and decide the best pitch.
3. What Would You Do:
A three-round contest in which students will face intense and challenging scenarios. Quick decisions will have to be made to win the contest.
For Anmol and Disha, leadership is an act of improving each other’s lives, and having interactions with pioneering mentors will help students find their path. “We think that a mentor or a leadership figure will enhance the students’ capabilities and drive them to do what they really want to do,” says Associate Team Lead Disha, a student of
B.Tech. Food Technology
.
Outlining the purpose behind organising the event, she adds, “The main target audience are the students who are trying to find their purpose in life and also bring about a change in the process. Even if one lesson from a mentor does that for one student, the event will be a success.”
A strong sense of self is evident as they speak – a trait they attribute to the role models in their families. “I look up to my father. If one day I can become even an iota of the person he is, it will be a huge achievement for me,” Anmol says. For Disha, her grandmother is her inspiration. “My grandmother lost her father when she was very young. Despite the hurdles, she paved her way and became successful in her field. She retired as the principal of a school.”
So what are you waiting for? Get ready to be inspired.

It is time to get inspired at the ‘Leadership Conclave’ 2021

(L-R) UPES students Disha Tripathi and Anmol Singhal, lead organizers of ‘The Leadership Conclave 2021’
The two-day event, being organised by student team ‘Fearless Falcons’, will be held on August 28-29 and will feature prominent leaders and students from across the country
Since the inception of the
UPES School for Life
– an institution that nurtures students to develop comprehensive skills for personal and professional success – several students have undertaken projects with the intent to create a profound impact in the world around them.
That these change-makers are so young only makes their passion to lead much more impressive. At a time when the global problems are on a surge, it is essential – and refreshing – to see Generation Z take charge.
‘Fearless Falcons’ is one such cohort of students who are helping the youth to ‘find their fire’. Led by UPES students Anmol Singhal and Disha Tripathi, the team is organising a ‘Leadership Conclave’ under the banner of School for Life. The team members working for the event include Aditya Pilani, Aryan Deopa, Ayush Patidar, Falguni Soni, Hinika Shail, Vagisha Khandelwal, Mrittika Bajaj, Himali and Harsh Baranwal.
The virtual seminar will be held on August 28-29, 2021, and will witness the participation of eminent leaders and students from across the country. The recorded sessions will be premiered on the
Fearless Falcons’ YouTube channel
.
Detailing the schedule of the conclave, Team Lead Anmol, who is studying
Computer Science and Engineering
with a specialisation in AI and ML, says, “Day 1 will feature several prominent guest speakers who will discuss their insights on leadership; on day 2, a variety of meaningful activities will take place. For the event, we are receiving registrations from students of various institutions such as BITS Pilani and Indian Institute of Management.”
Activities on Day 2 include:
1. Stock Triumph:
A combination of fate, skill and strategy, ‘The Stock Triumph,’ is a game based on the stock marketplace that will allow students to put their talents to the test using news flashes and real-time data.
2. Pitch Arena:
Students will present their business model/start-up idea and let the audience scrutinize and decide the best pitch.
3. What Would You Do:
A three-round contest in which students will face intense and challenging scenarios. Quick decisions will have to be made to win the contest.
For Anmol and Disha, leadership is an act of improving each other’s lives, and having interactions with pioneering mentors will help students find their path. “We think that a mentor or a leadership figure will enhance the students’ capabilities and drive them to do what they really want to do,” says Associate Team Lead Disha, a student of
B.Tech. Food Technology
.
Outlining the purpose behind organising the event, she adds, “The main target audience are the students who are trying to find their purpose in life and also bring about a change in the process. Even if one lesson from a mentor does that for one student, the event will be a success.”
A strong sense of self is evident as they speak – a trait they attribute to the role models in their families. “I look up to my father. If one day I can become even an iota of the person he is, it will be a huge achievement for me,” Anmol says. For Disha, her grandmother is her inspiration. “My grandmother lost her father when she was very young. Despite the hurdles, she paved her way and became successful in her field. She retired as the principal of a school.”
So what are you waiting for? Get ready to be inspired.
