Sustainable Development Goals

Overview
The Sustainable Development Goals are 17 global objectives adopted by all UN Member States in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Universities are vital for sustainable development goals by promoting research, quality education, and innovation. They are integral to civil society and promote global and local partnerships.
At UPES, located in the State of Uttarakhand in the foothills of Himalayas we believe in the transformative power of education to drive positive change. Our commitment extends beyond academic excellence to a profound dedication to addressing global challenges and fostering sustainable development. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) serve as our guiding principles, shaping our initiatives and endeavours to create a better, more sustainable future. We strive to align our efforts with the SDGs by focusing on key areas such as quality education, clean energy, and gender equality. Through partnerships with industry leaders and community engagement programs, we aim to empower individuals and communities to actively contribute towards achieving these goals. By integrating sustainability into our curriculum and research projects, we are preparing our students to become future leaders who can drive meaningful change in their respective fields.
The state of Uttarakhand boasts a remarkable geographical composition, with 86% of its terrain comprising hills and approximately 72% covered by forests. Given this distinctive geographic setting, the University, positioned within this landscape, finds immense scope and opportunities for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Demonstrating a steadfast commitment to community and societal development, the University's dedication is evident in the recently published report, accessible through the following link: [insert link]. This report highlights the University's proactive engagement and contributions toward achieving sustainability objectives within the region.
Surrounded by the awe-inspiring natural beauty and rich biodiversity of Uttarakhand, UPES has a distinct advantage in addressing local needs and fostering sustainability. The state's serene landscapes and abundant natural resources provide a practical setting for initiatives related to clean energy, environmental conservation, and community development. UPES leverages its geographical advantage to create a holistic educational environment, actively contributing to the realization of the SDGs. Through partnerships and community engagement, UPES strives to empower individuals and communities to actively contribute to achieving these vital global goals.
