FAQs
Has UPES been approved by AICTE?

This has also been clarified by the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s judgment in the case of Bharathidasan University v/s AICTE wherein the Court had ruled that:
“it is not mandatory for a University, created under an Act, to seek & secure prior approval of the AICTE to start a department for imparting a course or program in technical education or a technical institution as an adjunct to the University itself to conduct technical courses of its choice & selection. The Bench also said that the definition of technical institution excludes from its purview a university, and when by definition a university is excluded from a technical institution, to interpret that such a clause or such an expression, wherever the expression technical institution occurs, will include a university will be reading into the Act what is not provided therein”

What are the hostel facilities and infrastructure like at UPES?
Residential blocks have been earmarked for limited on-campus accommodation (on a first-come-first-serve basis) separately for boys and girls on a triple-sharing basis. Apart from this, there are several private hostels and paying guest accommodations available for students in the vicinity of the campus. UPES does not have any direct or indirect tie-up whatsoever with the private hostels and does not undertake any responsibility in this regard. Parents are advised to verify the data independently before finalising any arrangement with the concerned hostel and sign a written contract with the hostel owners. Parents are also advised against making advance payments without verifying the facilities. They should insist on a written agreement with the hostel owner, which should clearly state the payment modalities.
