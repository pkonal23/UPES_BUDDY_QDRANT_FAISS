How UPES is keeping pace with emerging technologies
Ekta Kashyap
Published 28/07/2022
UPES campus in Dehradun
UPES has always encouraged learning that reacts to the evolving needs and demands of the world; learning that uses a combination of technology and human power to take education a notch higher every day
Technology has pervaded all aspects of human existence at a pace never seen before. Work, learning, relationships, ageing, sickness, parenting, and socialising are all changing as a result of technologies ranging from augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, brain-computer interfaces, chip implants, biometrics, social media and more.
Activities in the metaverse are already gaining traction with investors, marketers and businesses buying virtual real estate, creating virtual islands, and building digital restaurants with home delivery features. Soon people may even be able to adopt virtual children in the digital environment. And so, companies are hiring talent that can fulfil their metaverse dreams.
When it comes to the development of new technologies and engineering, problem-solving is at the core. Electric vehicles to self-driving cars that can go anywhere, AI-fighter pilots to 3D printing that promises everything from low-cost house construction to printed bones, the possibilities are unfathomable. Only yesterday, we were talking about robots that can perform repetitive tasks with a higher degree of precision and accuracy; today, we have living robots made using stem cells that can reproduce. This is both profound and exhilarating.
Renewable energy also took a whole new leap with the creation of batteries that can be fuelled by gravity and smartwatches that can be powered by the user’s sweat.
In business, a decade ago, companies reacted according to the demands of the consumers. Now, companies can foresee the needs of the consumers basis the data generated by them on the internet. Smart factories, additive manufacturing and generative designs are also ushering in a new era of efficient production.
Intelligent virtual assistants are redefining the way companies handle customers; algorithms are designing clothes. There is an AI software that can generate images from only verbal prompts; super-insulated clothing that can eliminate the need for indoor heating; a fabric that can detect a heartbeat, handclaps and faint sounds. This wearable technology can help the blind, detect cracks or strains in buildings, and can be woven into fishnets to detect the sound of fish.
Technological innovations in healthcare are spurring unprecedented investment in genomic sequencing. AI programs are solving the long-standing biological puzzle of protein folding, potentially allowing for the rapid development of drugs for a wide range of diseases. Immune engineering is working toward fighting diseases like cancer by using the patient’s own cells.
In the legal profession, the inclusion of digital technology has had both qualitative and quantitative implications. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are being used to help judges in analysing facts, processing courtroom discussions, assisting lawyers in legal research, as well as document review and drafting.
By revolutionising the way we communicate, digital media is establishing a new global order. Everyone now has access to the tools needed to create and distribute content, and more importantly, everyone has a voice thanks to the internet. This is demonstrated by the rising user base and the volume of digital content created and distributed globally. The traditional media players have seen their business models challenged in the twenty-first century. They now have to compete with digital platforms for consumers’ time and attention.
Such radical shifts have opened doors to both opportunities and uncertainties. UPES has kept pace with the advances of technology by continuously updating its educational blueprint to adapt to this technological disruption. Our advanced curriculum complemented with academic collaborations and industry tie-ups guide students with industry-specific knowledge along with the knowledge and tools pertinent to the future of technology.
School of Engineering offers specialisations in fields such as Internet of Things, Data Analytics, Blockchain, Self-Driven Vehicles, 5G Communication and Technology, Smart Grid and Computing, E-Mobility, Robotics and Automation, Digital Oilfield and Green Buildings. Students at School of Engineering have already showcased flagship projects on human-like robots, flying cars, electric cycle, waste management, water security, solar driers and Biochar Bio Briquette (an alternate energy source).
At School of Computer Science, new-age specialisations include Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Big Data, Business Analytics and Optimisation, Cloud Computing and Virtualisation Technology, Cyber Security and Forensics, DevOps, and Full Stack Development, Graphics and Gaming, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, Cryptography and Blockchain.
Programs such as B.Tech. (Computer Science and Engineering) Graphics and Gaming and B.Des. Interaction Design, along with the infrastructure at the School of Design’s XR lab, have the potential to become major contributors to the development of Metaverse.
School of Business, with its focus on digital transformation and entrepreneurial mindset, is offering new-age programs such as Digital Media Laws, Start-Up & Entrepreneurship, Digital Marketing and E-commerce. The school has collaborated with KPMG for two programs MBA (Strategy & Consulting) – Business Innovation and Leadership, and MBA (Strategy & Consulting) – Emerging Strategies in New Economies.
School of Health Sciences and Technology has tech-ahead programs like Biomedical Engineering, Genomics and Biotechnology, which are going to be the next frontier in the field. These programs have components of technology, application and healthcare. The School has an exclusive collaboration with GE Healthcare for the Biomedical Engineering Program.
School of Law is one of the few higher education institutions offering LLM with a specialisation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. UPES is also home to India’s only digital first media school – School of Modern Media – that offers digitally-driven programs along with state-of-the-art advanced studio.
UPES, ‘The University of Tomorrow’, has always encouraged learning that reacts to the evolving needs and demands of the world; learning that uses a combination of technology and human power to take education a notch higher every day.

Electric vehicles to self-driving cars that can go anywhere, AI-fighter pilots to 3D printing that promises everything from low-cost house construction to printed bones, the possibilities are unfathomable. Only yesterday, we were talking about robots that can perform repetitive tasks with a higher degree of precision and accuracy; today, we have living robots made using stem cells that can reproduce. This is both profound and exhilarating.
Renewable energy also took a whole new leap with the creation of batteries that can be fuelled by gravity and smartwatches that can be powered by the user’s sweat.
In business, a decade ago, companies reacted according to the demands of the consumers. Now, companies can foresee the needs of the consumers basis the data generated by them on the internet. Smart factories, additive manufacturing and generative designs are also ushering in a new era of efficient production.
Intelligent virtual assistants are redefining the way companies handle customers; algorithms are designing clothes. There is an AI software that can generate images from only verbal prompts; super-insulated clothing that can eliminate the need for indoor heating; a fabric that can detect a heartbeat, handclaps and faint sounds. This wearable technology can help the blind, detect cracks or strains in buildings, and can be woven into fishnets to detect the sound of fish.
Technological innovations in healthcare are spurring unprecedented investment in genomic sequencing. AI programs are solving the long-standing biological puzzle of protein folding, potentially allowing for the rapid development of drugs for a wide range of diseases. Immune engineering is working toward fighting diseases like cancer by using the patient’s own cells.
In the legal profession, the inclusion of digital technology has had both qualitative and quantitative implications. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are being used to help judges in analysing facts, processing courtroom discussions, assisting lawyers in legal research, as well as document review and drafting.
By revolutionising the way we communicate, digital media is establishing a new global order. Everyone now has access to the tools needed to create and distribute content, and more importantly, everyone has a voice thanks to the internet. This is demonstrated by the rising user base and the volume of digital content created and distributed globally. The traditional media players have seen their business models challenged in the twenty-first century. They now have to compete with digital platforms for consumers’ time and attention.
Such radical shifts have opened doors to both opportunities and uncertainties. UPES has kept pace with the advances of technology by continuously updating its educational blueprint to adapt to this technological disruption. Our advanced curriculum complemented with academic collaborations and industry tie-ups guide students with industry-specific knowledge along with the knowledge and tools pertinent to the future of technology.
School of Engineering offers specialisations in fields such as Internet of Things, Data Analytics, Blockchain, Self-Driven Vehicles, 5G Communication and Technology, Smart Grid and Computing, E-Mobility, Robotics and Automation, Digital Oilfield and Green Buildings. Students at School of Engineering have already showcased flagship projects on human-like robots, flying cars, electric cycle, waste management, water security, solar driers and Biochar Bio Briquette (an alternate energy source).
At School of Computer Science, new-age specialisations include Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Big Data, Business Analytics and Optimisation, Cloud Computing and Virtualisation Technology, Cyber Security and Forensics, DevOps, and Full Stack Development, Graphics and Gaming, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, Cryptography and Blockchain.
Programs such as B.Tech. (Computer Science and Engineering) Graphics and Gaming and B.Des. Interaction Design, along with the infrastructure at the School of Design’s XR lab, have the potential to become major contributors to the development of Metaverse.
School of Business, with its focus on digital transformation and entrepreneurial mindset, is offering new-age programs such as Digital Media Laws, Start-Up & Entrepreneurship, Digital Marketing and E-commerce. The school has collaborated with KPMG for two programs MBA (Strategy & Consulting) – Business Innovation and Leadership, and MBA (Strategy & Consulting) – Emerging Strategies in New Economies.
School of Health Sciences and Technology has tech-ahead programs like Biomedical Engineering, Genomics and Biotechnology, which are going to be the next frontier in the field. These programs have components of technology, application and healthcare. The School has an exclusive collaboration with GE Healthcare for the Biomedical Engineering Program.
School of Law is one of the few higher education institutions offering LLM with a specialisation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. UPES is also home to India’s only digital first media school – School of Modern Media – that offers digitally-driven programs along with state-of-the-art advanced studio.
UPES, ‘The University of Tomorrow’, has always encouraged learning that reacts to the evolving needs and demands of the world; learning that uses a combination of technology and human power to take education a notch higher every day.

UPES has always encouraged learning that reacts to the evolving needs and demands of the world; learning that uses a combination of technology and human power to take education a notch higher every day
Technology has pervaded all aspects of human existence at a pace never seen before. Work, learning, relationships, ageing, sickness, parenting, and socialising are all changing as a result of technologies ranging from augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, brain-computer interfaces, chip implants, biometrics, social media and more.
Activities in the metaverse are already gaining traction with investors, marketers and businesses buying virtual real estate, creating virtual islands, and building digital restaurants with home delivery features. Soon people may even be able to adopt virtual children in the digital environment. And so, companies are hiring talent that can fulfil their metaverse dreams.
