Dr. Prashant Kumar Chaurasia

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Prashant is highly respected as an expert in statistics. He has a strong knowledge of both the theory and practical applications of statistics and has made important contributions to areas like statistical modelling, data analysis, and probability. He is known for his clear teaching style and his passion for the subject, inspiring many students and researchers. His research is innovative and tackles real-world problems using advanced statistical methods. Professor Prashant's dedication to improving the field and his commitment to excellence have earned him great respect in the academic community.
Work Experience
Dr. Prashant has held several academic positions across prestigious institutions.

Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Prashant believes that it is his responsibility to create a learning environment that encourages and supports students. He uses a "flipped classroom" approach, where students read assigned sections from textbooks or other resources before class. In class, students take a short quiz based on what they’ve read. Instead of reviewing the quiz, it uses it as a foundation for activities where students work with real-world data and problems. This approach helps students move from basic to more advanced levels of understanding.
