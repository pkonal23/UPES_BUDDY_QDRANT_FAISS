Profile Summary
In management schools, they teach you that goals are important. What's also equally important is the journey towards those goals. That's part of what I taught at Shiv Nadar University, BML Munjal University, IMT Ghaziabad and now at UPES Dehradun. Every day is a day of giving, guidance, and mentoring.
Two decades and more in corporate life, working in large MNCs with some wonderful people, while living in several countries for 20 years, has given me the ability to appreciate cultural diversity, build winning teams spread across multiple time zones, understand emotional drivers, and norms of doing business globally. Navigating through two major crises – the Asian financial collapse and SARS in Hong Kong, gave me the opportunity to face disruption, and constructively carve success stories where none seemed possible.
That experience has come in handy. I constantly challenge MBA students to look at problems from different angles and explore creative solutions. I enjoy the vibrancy and energy at the campus, as well as the opportunity to grow the management discipline of Strategy into a demanding yet enjoyable and rewarding career.
The best reward came from my students, who awarded me 4.9/5 in a survey a few months earlier. What more can I ask for? Sure, the next best reward would be to see my students in top leadership positions in the coming years.
Work Experience
Prof. Majumdar has over 30 years of experience in the corporate and academic world. His career in corporate was with Ernst & Young (1 year), Carrier Corporation in India & Malaysia (8 years), Emerson in Hong Kong (12 years), Danfoss in France (3 years), Embraco (a Whirlpool company) in Beijing (2 years). After returning to India, he set up his own management consulting firm, Trariti Consulting Group that helps companies achieve profitable growth. HIs entire corporate experience has been to build/grow businesses. Since the past 2 years, he shifted to academia, and as Professor of Strategy, has taught MBA students in Shiv Nadar University, BML Munjal University and IMT Ghaziabad.

Profile Summary
In management schools, they teach you that goals are important. What's also equally important is the journey towards those goals. That's part of what I taught at Shiv Nadar University, BML Munjal University, IMT Ghaziabad and now at UPES Dehradun. Every day is a day of giving, guidance, and mentoring.
Two decades and more in corporate life, working in large MNCs with some wonderful people, while living in several countries for 20 years, has given me the ability to appreciate cultural diversity, build winning teams spread across multiple time zones, understand emotional drivers, and norms of doing business globally. Navigating through two major crises – the Asian financial collapse and SARS in Hong Kong, gave me the opportunity to face disruption, and constructively carve success stories where none seemed possible.
That experience has come in handy. I constantly challenge MBA students to look at problems from different angles and explore creative solutions. I enjoy the vibrancy and energy at the campus, as well as the opportunity to grow the management discipline of Strategy into a demanding yet enjoyable and rewarding career.
The best reward came from my students, who awarded me 4.9/5 in a survey a few months earlier. What more can I ask for? Sure, the next best reward would be to see my students in top leadership positions in the coming years.
Work Experience
Prof. Majumdar has over 30 years of experience in the corporate and academic world. His career in corporate was with Ernst & Young (1 year), Carrier Corporation in India & Malaysia (8 years), Emerson in Hong Kong (12 years), Danfoss in France (3 years), Embraco (a Whirlpool company) in Beijing (2 years). After returning to India, he set up his own management consulting firm, Trariti Consulting Group that helps companies achieve profitable growth. HIs entire corporate experience has been to build/grow businesses. Since the past 2 years, he shifted to academia, and as Professor of Strategy, has taught MBA students in Shiv Nadar University, BML Munjal University and IMT Ghaziabad.
