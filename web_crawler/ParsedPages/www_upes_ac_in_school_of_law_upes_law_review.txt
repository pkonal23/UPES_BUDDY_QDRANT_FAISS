We are pleased to announce that UPES Law Review has successfully launched its VIII Volume on the theme of ‘Contemporary issues in Law and Society’. The journal is now entering its IX cycle with the theme “Law, Society and Politics” and we are delighted to invite submissions from academicians, professionals, industry experts and scholars for the upcoming cycle.
The modern political system treats law as a strait jacket solution to most of the problems, which has also raised questions on the adequacy and efficacy of the legal systems. The analysis of the issues in the implementation of the law has highlighted the intersection of law, society, and politics, and we need to foster discussions on contemporary issues from different socio-legal-political perspectives. The postmodern approach to law has enriched the discourse by acknowledging the interdisciplinarity of the problem. It is imperative to study the impact of theories of economics, political science, economics, and sociology on law. The law doesn’t operate in a vacuum; it impacts society and gets affected by social and political events. Thus, it becomes essential to examine the impact and relationship of law on issues of morality, rights and duties, crime and punishment, free speech, democracy, inequality, private property etc.
The legal system is also undergoing constant change because of the advent of technology and AI. It has given rise to concerns like personal privacy, data privacy, and cybercrime. The digitization of the economy has also led to threats of online financial fraud. The legal system also needs to address these manifold concerns.
The challenges coming from society are diverse and are evolving constantly. Adapting to these challenges requires collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to upholding justice, equality, and the rule of law in an increasingly interconnected and complex world. As States strive to navigate this ever-changing landscape, it is inevitable to understand the impact of these challenges on the relationship between law, society, and politics.
The focus of the issue is to discuss how law plays regulative and coercive roles in society and how social, political, and cultural forces impact the legal system.
The following themes are suggested:
New Social Movements
Freedom of Speech and Expression and Hate Speeches
Gender Jurisprudence
Media and Democracy
Climate Change and Sustainability
Human Rights and Social Justice
Global Governance and International Law
Social Inequality and Poverty
Governance and accountability
Electoral System - One Nation One Election, Electoral Bonds, etc.
Politics of Private Property
Personal Laws and Rights
Labour Jurisprudence
Technology and Law
Comparitive Constitutional Law
Note: The above sub-themes are only illustrative. UPES Law Review would welcome papers on other topics related to Law, Society and Politics.

The law doesn’t operate in a vacuum; it impacts society and gets affected by social and political events. Thus, it becomes essential to examine the impact and relationship of law on issues of morality, rights and duties, crime and punishment, free speech, democracy, inequality, private property etc.
The legal system is also undergoing constant change because of the advent of technology and AI. It has given rise to concerns like personal privacy, data privacy, and cybercrime. The digitization of the economy has also led to threats of online financial fraud. The legal system also needs to address these manifold concerns.
The challenges coming from society are diverse and are evolving constantly. Adapting to these challenges requires collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to upholding justice, equality, and the rule of law in an increasingly interconnected and complex world. As States strive to navigate this ever-changing landscape, it is inevitable to understand the impact of these challenges on the relationship between law, society, and politics.
The focus of the issue is to discuss how law plays regulative and coercive roles in society and how social, political, and cultural forces impact the legal system.
The following themes are suggested:
New Social Movements
Freedom of Speech and Expression and Hate Speeches
Gender Jurisprudence
Media and Democracy
Climate Change and Sustainability
Human Rights and Social Justice
Global Governance and International Law
Social Inequality and Poverty
Governance and accountability
Electoral System - One Nation One Election, Electoral Bonds, etc.
Politics of Private Property
Personal Laws and Rights
Labour Jurisprudence
Technology and Law
Comparitive Constitutional Law
Note: The above sub-themes are only illustrative. UPES Law Review would welcome papers on other topics related to Law, Society and Politics.

We are pleased to announce that UPES Law Review has successfully launched its VIII Volume on the theme of ‘Contemporary issues in Law and Society’. The journal is now entering its IX cycle with the theme “Law, Society and Politics” and we are delighted to invite submissions from academicians, professionals, industry experts and scholars for the upcoming cycle.

The modern political system treats law as a strait jacket solution to most of the problems, which has also raised questions on the adequacy and efficacy of the legal systems. The analysis of the issues in the implementation of the law has highlighted the intersection of law, society, and politics, and we need to foster discussions on contemporary issues from different socio-legal-political perspectives. The postmodern approach to law has enriched the discourse by acknowledging the interdisciplinarity of the problem. It is imperative to study the impact of theories of economics, political science, economics, and sociology on law. The law doesn’t operate in a vacuum; it impacts society and gets affected by social and political events. Thus, it becomes essential to examine the impact and relationship of law on issues of morality, rights and duties, crime and punishment, free speech, democracy, inequality, private property etc.

The legal system is also undergoing constant change because of the advent of technology and AI. It has given rise to concerns like personal privacy, data privacy, and cybercrime. The digitization of the economy has also led to threats of online financial fraud. The legal system also needs to address these manifold concerns.
