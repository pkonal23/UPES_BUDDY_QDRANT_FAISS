What is the Difference Between Lawyer and Advocate?
UPES Editorial Team
Published 20/12/2024
Table of Contents:
Difference between a Lawyer & Advocate
Difference in responsibilities
Scope of Practise
Specialisation
Experience
Fees & Salary
Have you ever found yourself in a courtroom drama (real or Netflix) and thought, "Wait, aren’t lawyers and advocates the same thing?" Well, spoiler alert: they’re not! Though we often find people using these two terms interchangeably, the difference is significant! EVERY Advocate is a Lawyer, but every Lawyer is NOT an Advocate. Read on to decode the differences, the similarities, and more in detail.
Difference between Lawyer and Advocate?
A Lawyer is a person with a law degree like B.A. LL.B. or BB.A. LL.B., and eligible to give advice but not represent a client in a court of law unless he is registered with the Bar Council of a state. An Advocate on the other hand is registered with the Bar Council of a state and represents a client in a court of law. The term "lawyer" refers to anyone in the legal profession, including solicitors, barristers, and attorneys. An advocate is a professional who specializes in representing clients in legal procedures.
Become future-ready with our Law programs
Know More
Differences in terms of Responsibilities:
For a Lawyer:
The responsibilities of a lawyer are listed below:
Attend Trials and Hearings in the Court
Work in close collaboration with the police and the investigators
Conduct a case review and give legal advice to clients
Book the calendar for interviews, assessments, and meetings with clients
Conduct research and accumulate legal evidence in favour of client
Educate clients on their Constitutional rights
For an Advocate:
The responsibilities of an advocate are listed below:
Represent the Client in the Court of Law
Help the police and the investigators in preparing well before standing in front of the court
Send notifications to authorities in case of any complaint against court officials
Conduct thorough legal research concerning the case
Observe court etiquette and good conduct
Provide the court with the necessary evidence to reach a conclusion in a legal situation
Scope of Practise:
Lawyers are qualified to provide legal advice to individuals and organizations, including companies, colleges, and universities. In addition to offering guidance, they draft essential documents needed for legal processes. However, they are not permitted to practice in a court of law unless they meet specific requirements. Advocates, on the other hand, specialize in representing and advocating for their clients in court. Lawyers can also practice in court if they enrol with a state bar council. To do so, they must first register and then pass the All-India Bar Exam (AIBE), which qualifies them to represent and defend clients in court.
Specialisations:
Most lawyers and advocates opt to specialize in a specific area of law while in law school or after graduating. Individuals who practice law can provide legal advice and support in any area of specialization. Some of the most common specialisations include:
Real Estate
Family
Criminal
Constitutional
Corporate
Immigration
Labour
Environmental
Personal Injury and more
Intellectual Property
Taxation
Experience:
When it comes to experience, Advocates are the bigger sharks! They are more experienced from practising in multiple judicial settings throughout their careers. They are adept in representing their clients in the court of law and turning court’s judgements in their client’s favour.
Lawyers are legal experts who have recently graduated from law school and do not have the essential experience. They are aware of the law, including statutes, rules and regulations, and legal precedents. However, when it comes to experience, the lawyer's years of court practice are zero.
Fees and Salary:
The Fee of an Advocate depends on his social standing and his expertise. However, his fee is more than a lawyer because he represents his client in the court of law and fights the case on his behalf which a lawyer cannot do.
The starting salary of both the lawyer and the advocate is 1 lakh. It can go up to 9-11 lacs as average salary per annum.
Our counsellors are just a click away.

In addition to offering guidance, they draft essential documents needed for legal processes. However, they are not permitted to practice in a court of law unless they meet specific requirements. Advocates, on the other hand, specialize in representing and advocating for their clients in court. Lawyers can also practice in court if they enrol with a state bar council. To do so, they must first register and then pass the All-India Bar Exam (AIBE), which qualifies them to represent and defend clients in court.
Specialisations:
Most lawyers and advocates opt to specialize in a specific area of law while in law school or after graduating. Individuals who practice law can provide legal advice and support in any area of specialization. Some of the most common specialisations include:
Real Estate
Family
Criminal
Constitutional
Corporate
Immigration
Labour
Environmental
Personal Injury and more
Intellectual Property
Taxation
Experience:
When it comes to experience, Advocates are the bigger sharks! They are more experienced from practising in multiple judicial settings throughout their careers. They are adept in representing their clients in the court of law and turning court’s judgements in their client’s favour.
Lawyers are legal experts who have recently graduated from law school and do not have the essential experience. They are aware of the law, including statutes, rules and regulations, and legal precedents. However, when it comes to experience, the lawyer's years of court practice are zero.
Fees and Salary:
The Fee of an Advocate depends on his social standing and his expertise. However, his fee is more than a lawyer because he represents his client in the court of law and fights the case on his behalf which a lawyer cannot do.
The starting salary of both the lawyer and the advocate is 1 lakh. It can go up to 9-11 lacs as average salary per annum.

Have you ever found yourself in a courtroom drama (real or Netflix) and thought, "Wait, aren’t lawyers and advocates the same thing?" Well, spoiler alert: they’re not! Though we often find people using these two terms interchangeably, the difference is significant! EVERY Advocate is a Lawyer, but every Lawyer is NOT an Advocate. Read on to decode the differences, the similarities, and more in detail.
Difference between Lawyer and Advocate?
A Lawyer is a person with a law degree like B.A. LL.B. or BB.A. LL.B., and eligible to give advice but not represent a client in a court of law unless he is registered with the Bar Council of a state. An Advocate on the other hand is registered with the Bar Council of a state and represents a client in a court of law. The term "lawyer" refers to anyone in the legal profession, including solicitors, barristers, and attorneys. An advocate is a professional who specializes in representing clients in legal procedures.
