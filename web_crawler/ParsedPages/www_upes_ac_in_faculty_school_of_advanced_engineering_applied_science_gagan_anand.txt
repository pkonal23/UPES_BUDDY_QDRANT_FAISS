Dr. Gagan Anand

Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Gagan Anand works on the concentration of Calcium in Strontium Bismuth titanate ceramics for high-temperature sensor applications, as an alternative to Lead-based materials like PZT/PLZT, etc. With vast experience in leading educational institutions, he served as the Controller of Examination at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH) [affiliated College], and was a core committee member for NBA (National Board of Accreditation) accreditation for St’ Martins Engineering College.
Work Experience
His teaching experience spans over 23 years in various leading colleges in India. He earned his doctorate in physics from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad and is known for his proactive approach as a self-motivated professional. He has previously worked as an Assistant Professor at Vignan Institute of Technology and Science, Hyderabad, India, and as an Assistant Professor & Controller of Examinations at St. Martin's Engineering College, Dhulpally, Hyderabad, India. Since July 2011, he has held various positions, starting from Assistant Professor (Selection Grade), then becoming an Associate Professor in July 2014, and currently, he is a Professor since January 2022 at UPES, Dehradun, India.
Research Interests
Prof. Gagan's areas of interest include the preparation and study of Bismuth layered structured ferroelectric materials used for high-energy sensor applications. He has collaborated with Dr. P. Sarah, Prof & Head R&D, Vardaman College of Engineering, Hyderabad, and Dr. A. R. James, Scientist E, DMRL, Kanchan Bagh, Hyderabad. After joining UPES, he also started research on Nano-Fluids, specifically focusing on CNT (Carbon nanotubes) based on 2 and 4-wheeler engine oils.
Teaching Philosophy
Prof. Gagan's teaching philosophy centers around recognizing the unique learning needs of adults and fostering empathy toward students. He enthusiastically employs diverse active learning techniques, including brainstorming, discussions based on case studies, and live demonstrations. To captivate student interest, he also utilizes imaginative methods like incorporating games, storytelling, and leveraging Mnemonics.
Courses Taught
Prof. Gagan teaches courses in Solid-state Physics, Applied Physics, Engineering Physics, Electromagnetic Theory, Introduction to Nanotechnology, Optical Fiber Communication, Electrical, Electronics, and Magnetic Materials.
Awards and Grants
He has received multiple awards, including the merit award for organizing the Mission 10x program for teaching faculty and duties as proctor. He was also honoured with the Young Scientist Award (team lead) from Uttarakhand Council for Science and Technology. Additionally, he was a guest of honour at Chandigarh University, Mohali, India, and DVR College of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad, India.
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Gagan Anand is a highly accomplished researcher in the field of materials science, with a specialization in the preparation and study of Bismuth layered structured ferroelectric materials for high-energy sensor applications. He has made significant contributions to this area of research through his extensive work and collaborations with leading experts. During his tenure as a researcher under the guidance of Dr. P. Sarah in Hyderabad and working alongside Dr. A. R. James, Scientist G, Dr. Anand has demonstrated exceptional dedication and expertise. His research efforts have resulted in the publication of 30 research papers in well-regarded journals indexed in Scopus/SCI, highlighting the quality and impact of his work. Dr. Anand has focused on understanding fundamental properties, optimizing synthesis methods, and investigating potential applications in sensing technologies.
