There is an increasing recognition that hybrid, blended and online access for students is an important part of modern educational strategy.
At the University of Tomorrow, most courses will be online and delivered at near-zero marginal cost. The key objective has been to provide 24x7 access to students, whenever, wherever and in the manner they learn best.
We believe that offering a unique state-of-the-art, cutting-edge digital experience ensures a differentiated experience for our students. Our distinct online experience focused on student engagement and success, drives meaningful outcomes to support student achievement and career advancement.
In order to serve as the backbone for the entire initiative, a state-of-the-art mobile-enabled virtual learning and collaboration platform was implemented which replaced the University's legacy systems.
Recognizing the need for video production in today's educational context, UPES set up an e-studio with integrated platforms which enabled faculty members to create video lectures.
UPES practises and encourages its faculty to implement blended learning through a mix of teaching methods for a more comprehensive learning experience. This includes classroom training, e-learning, video lectures, online assessments, and interactive digital textbooks which contain embedded animations.
UPES has received two Blackboard Catalyst awards – for optimizing student learning experience in 2018, and for professional development of faculty in 2019.
In 2021, UPES bagged three more awards for leading change, student learning experiences, and teaching and learning.
