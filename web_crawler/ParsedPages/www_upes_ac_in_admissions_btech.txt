Course Overview
About B.Tech. Courses
B.Tech., also known as Bachelor of Technology, is a four-year undergraduate program that focuses on providing students with a solid foundation in engineering and technology. The B.Tech. curriculum typically includes a mix of theoretical and practical coursework, with a strong emphasis on hands-on experience through laboratory work and projects. The program is designed to prepare students for a career in the field of engineering, whether it be in research, development, or application.
At UPES, B.Tech. programs are offered in a wide range of disciplines. Each program is tailored to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in a specific field of engineering.
In addition to the technical coursework, B.Tech. students also take courses in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as well as courses in other related fields such as economics and management. This broad-based education provides students with a well-rounded understanding of the engineering field and helps to prepare them for the diverse range of career opportunities available to them upon graduation.
The B.Tech. program is one of the most sought after courses. Graduates of B.Tech. programs are in high demand, and typically go on to work in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, construction, transportation, and telecommunications, as well as in government and research institutions.
Overall, B.Tech. is an excellent choice for students who are interested in pursuing a career in engineering and technology and want to gain the knowledge and skills needed to excel in this field.
B.Tech. Specialisations
UPES offers a wide range of B. Tech. branches with specializations ranging from aerospace engineering to mechanical engineering. All B.Tech. courses last for a total of four years or eight semesters. The course curriculums for all B.Tech. branches have been specially customized with real-world requirements in mind.
Hence, it is no surprise that all the B.Tech. engineering courses have been accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA), the University Grants Commission of India (UGC), the Association of Indian Universities and the International Association of Universities.
