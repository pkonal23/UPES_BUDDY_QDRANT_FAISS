Overview

Overview

UPES is a multidisciplinary, not-for-profit, research-driven university dedicated to academic excellence, student success, and societal impact. As the 'University of Tomorrow', it transforms learners into changemakers across seven schools, including Computer Science, Engineering, Health Science, Design, Business, Law, and Liberal Studies, educating over 16,000+ students. UPES maintains global partnerships with institutions such as the University of California Berkeley, UNSW Sydney, University of Edinburgh, The University of Queensland, University of Bologna, University of Auckland and other such premiere institutions from across the globe.
Committed to cultivating research and innovation, UPES supports initiatives like SEED funding, advanced synthesis and characterisation facilities, and high-computation resources. At UPES, inclusivity and lifelong learning are integral to the university’s culture. The diverse academic community at UPES encourages a rich exchange of ideas, with students and faculty from varied backgrounds coming together to collaborate on innovative solutions. Through initiatives like Anusandhan, faculty and students are consistently exposed to the latest developments in their fields, ensuring that they remain at the cutting edge of global advancements. The IPR cell also facilitates global knowledge exchange, patents, and technology transfer.
UPES's commitment to cutting-edge research is evident through collaborations with prestigious organisations such as CERN and KEK in Switzerland and Japan, respectively, enabling its partnership in the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and Belle II projects.
UPES is one of India’s fastest-growing universities in research, achieving global standards with an output of four papers per faculty member annually and citation rates comparable to institutions like MIT and Oxford. Nearly 52% of its publications feature international co-authors, with a 374% growth in scholarly output since 2018. The Field-Weighted Citation Impact for 2023 stands at 1.68, with 28.4% of publications in top-tier journals.
UPES's remarkable research achievements are highlighted by its growing publication numbers. As of November 2024, the university has published 9,837 papers in SCOPUS and 6,219 in Web of Science, with total citations nearing 100,000. In 2024 alone, UPES recorded 1,670 publications in SCOPUS and 892 in Web of Science. Its impact is reflected in the growing H-index, currently at 99 in SCOPUS and 63 in Web of Science. Additionally, UPES has filed 759 patents, with 510 already granted, demonstrating its commitment to transforming research into practical and marketable innovations.
UPES academic community has leading scholars and researchers such as a Nobel Prize Nominee, Rhodes, Fulbright, Chevening, Commonwealth, Erasmus, Eiffel and DAAD scholars, trained at some of the best institutions in the world such as Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, University of California Berkeley, Oxford, Cambridge, National University of Singapore, Indian Institute of Science, IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) and so on. Initiatives like the SHODH scheme promote multidisciplinary innovation, resulting in patents, publications, and start-ups. Forty-six UPES faculty members are listed among the world’s top 2% of researchers, ranking the university 13th in India and 2nd among private universities in a prestigious study by Stanford University.
Furthermore, the university’s commitment to social responsibility and entrepreneurship is evident in its Runway Business Incubator, which supports students and alumni in launching startups that contribute to societal progress. By fostering an environment where innovation meets impact, UPES is shaping future leaders who are equipped not only with knowledge but also with the responsibility to drive positive change.
UPES is not just an educational institution; it is a dynamic ecosystem that thrives on research, innovation, academic excellence, and global collaboration. Its distinctive culture of continuous learning, coupled with an unwavering commitment to societal impact, makes UPES a leading force in shaping the next generation of global changemakers.
