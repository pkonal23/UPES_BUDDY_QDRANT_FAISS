Dr. Tapas Goswami

Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Tapas Goswami holds the position of Sr. Associate Professor at UPES, where his expertise spans across various fields, including physical chemistry, materials science, and laser spectroscopy. His current research focus revolves around the development of light harvesting materials, fluorescent sensors, and hetero-nanostructures for diverse applications. He earned his PhD in Physical Chemistry from IIT Kanpur in 2010, where he designed a sophisticated molecular beam chamber for coherent control of molecular fragmentation. As a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Stanford University and Michigan State University from 2010 to 2013, his research centered on photochemistry control using ultrafast laser pulses and understanding the dynamics of neutral chemical reactions. Dr. Goswami's work showcases his significant contributions to these cutting-edge fields.
Work Experience
After completing his PhD, Dr. Goswami took up a post-doctoral research position at Stanford University, CA, USA. Following that, he continued his post-doctoral research at Michigan State University, MI, USA. Prior to joining UPES, Prof. Goswami served as an Assistant Professor at Glocal University and BML Munjal University.
Research Interests
Development of Fluorescence nano-sensors I Photocatalysis I Photo-physical properties and applications of hetero-nanostructures
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Goswami’s teaching philosophy is based on two ideas: (i) great teachers are those who share their passion for knowledge and inquisitiveness with their students (ii) teachers must inspire students’ creativity and develop their critical thinking ability. As a teacher my first goal is to create an atmosphere that encourages students to involve and active participation in scientific discussions. Dr. Goswami follows student-centered approach in teaching and introduces the students to hands-on learning, real-world applications and importance of theoretical chemistry concepts.
Courses Taught
Dr. Goswami's teaching expertise lies in imparting fundamental concepts of Physical Chemistry to students pursuing MSc and BSc Chemistry courses. These concepts include Quantum Chemistry, Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy, Chemical Thermodynamics, and Statistical Thermodynamics. Additionally, he instructs elective courses covering topics such as Atomic Structure, Periodic Table, and Chemical Bonding. In addition, Dr. Goswami teaches Engineering Chemistry to first-year BTech students.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Goswami has been recognized with numerous prestigious awards and honors, including the NET-JRF and SRF from CSIR, India. He received Best Poster awards at the 9th Asian Conference on Quantum Information Science (AQIS'09) and the National Laser Symposium (NLS‐08). He also secured a National Scholarship and achieved an impressive 99.7 percentile in the Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineers (GATE-2005). Additionally, he was granted an esteemed International Travel grant from DST for attending and Oral presentation in an International Conference in ACUP-2010 held at National Taiwan University, Taiwan.
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Goswami is a multidisciplinary researcher who works on design, synthesis, characterization of hetero-nanostructure materials and their photophysical properties. He has published more than ~ 45 research articles in peer reviewed scientific journals. He is a reviewer of many reputed SCI indexed journals. Dr. Goswami has been actively involved in various educational and research activities by mentoring UG & PG students and providing opportunities for summer research internship to PG students. He is also an active participant in various national and international conferences/workshops to disseminate research discovery and knowledge through public lectures and discussions.

Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Goswami’s teaching philosophy is based on two ideas: (i) great teachers are those who share their passion for knowledge and inquisitiveness with their students (ii) teachers must inspire students’ creativity and develop their critical thinking ability. As a teacher my first goal is to create an atmosphere that encourages students to involve and active participation in scientific discussions. Dr. Goswami follows student-centered approach in teaching and introduces the students to hands-on learning, real-world applications and importance of theoretical chemistry concepts.
