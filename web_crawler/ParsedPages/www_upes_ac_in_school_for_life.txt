To meet the challenges of this constant, novel and ever-changing environment there is a need to re-imagine learning and education that is a balance between what students want, and what is needed of them as future global citizens and leaders of tomorrow.

About School For Life
In today's rapidly changing world, traditional education often falls short in preparing students for the challenges of the 21st century. Life skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration are essential for success in today's competitive landscape.
In 2020, amidst the global pandemic, we launched School for Life as a groundbreaking educational initiative to equip UPES students with essential 21st-century skills. The program offered life skills courses, exploratory courses, and signature courses to help our students become future leaders. We are proud to acknowledge the success of School for Life, which has inspired countless student success stories and garnered a remarkable reputation on the global stage, receiving numerous awards and accolades.
Our courses emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, innovation, adaptability, and ethical decision-making. Beyond the classroom, we offer a variety of experiential learning opportunities like projects, internships, co-ops, community service, and research projects to apply these skills in real-world scenarios. By nurturing the problems and skills, we aim to develop future leaders who can adapt to change, solve complex problems, and positively impact society.
