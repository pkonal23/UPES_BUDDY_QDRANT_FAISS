UPES Editorial Team
Published 25/01/2022
Image credit: Pixabay
Science has advanced at a rapid rate in recent years to produce technologies that benefit humanity, making biotechnology a major career option for the youth today
Biotechnology is a vast field of biology that involves the development or manufacture of items using living systems and organisms. It frequently integrates with related scientific subjects, depending on the tools and applications used. In the past, combining science and technology to solve global health issues has produced great outcomes.
In the modern day, biotechnology has grown to embrace new and varied sciences such as genomics, applied immunology, and the creation of pharmacological medicines and diagnostic tests.
With the immense potential of genomics and other advancements in the biological sciences, the role of biotechnological research to enhance public health and minimize global healthcare disparities is more important than ever before, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Biotechnology: Relevance in the modern world
The impact of biotechnological research and development can be seen across various industries, particularly in the healthcare industry. Biotechnology methods and techniques in the healthcare industry have brought up new research opportunities for figuring out how healthy bodies function and what goes wrong when they don’t. Understanding the molecular basis of health and illness also leads to more effective treatments and prevention strategies.
Because of modern biotechnology-based diagnostic techniques, we can now diagnose numerous illnesses and medical disorders more rapidly and accurately. The latest generation of home pregnancy tests, which yield more accurate results much sooner than previous tests, is perhaps the most notable example of this.
Biotechnology has become an important element of the medical world, whether it is the manufacture of genetically enhanced treatments for diseases, the strengthening of immunity against diseases, or the production of drugs and vaccines for the treatment of various diseases. Biotechnology products in human healthcare include more rapid and accurate diagnostic tests, medicines with minimal side effects, and newer and safer vaccines.
Another area of medicine where biotechnology has had a significant influence is in the reduction of diagnostic expenses.
Biotechnology has also resulted in the development of new types of genetic testing. There are about 1,000 such tests available now, many of which are for hereditary illnesses and others for disease predisposition. Other developing uses of genetic testing include predicting drug response and assisting with dietary planning.
Biotechnology, without a doubt, contributes significantly to the expanding public and global health demands. The need for biotechnology specialists has expanded dramatically as a result of Covid-19 exposing the necessity for medical professionals across numerous disciplines. People are now increasingly turning to biotechnology specialists to return their lives to normalcy, and this is where a degree in biotechnology becomes relevant.
B.Tech. in Biotechnology
Biotechnology Engineering is one of science and technology’s most advanced fields. From Physics, Chemistry, and Biology to Engineering and Mathematics, the discipline encompasses a wide range of concepts and principles that are combined to build products and solutions that improve human existence. Generally, a biotechnology engineer studies, improves, and develops bioprocesses from the laboratory to the factory-scale using an integrated approach that combines fundamental biological sciences and engineering concepts.
Science has advanced at a rapid rate in recent years to produce technologies that benefit humanity. As a result, choosing biotechnology as a major career path is one of the smartest choices you can make for your future.
You can also work in a variety of positions during the course of your career.  Biochemists, Biomedical Engineers, Bio-Manufacturing Specialists, Clinical Technicians, Medical Scientists, Process Development Scientists, Microbiologists, and others are some of the most well-known career pathways in biotechnology.
Get started with a B.Tech. in Biotechnology from UPES. At UPES, B.Tech. Biotechnology students specialising in Genomics & Biosimilars will learn about existing legislation, manufacturing technologies, and biosimilar product distribution procedures in India and throughout the world. Students will also study the discourse concerning generic drugs and the necessity for developing biosimilar products, amongst other things.

Science has advanced at a rapid rate in recent years to produce technologies that benefit humanity, making biotechnology a major career option for the youth today
Biotechnology is a vast field of biology that involves the development or manufacture of items using living systems and organisms. It frequently integrates with related scientific subjects, depending on the tools and applications used. In the past, combining science and technology to solve global health issues has produced great outcomes.
In the modern day, biotechnology has grown to embrace new and varied sciences such as genomics, applied immunology, and the creation of pharmacological medicines and diagnostic tests.
With the immense potential of genomics and other advancements in the biological sciences, the role of biotechnological research to enhance public health and minimize global healthcare disparities is more important than ever before, especially in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Biotechnology: Relevance in the modern world
The impact of biotechnological research and development can be seen across various industries, particularly in the healthcare industry. Biotechnology methods and techniques in the healthcare industry have brought up new research opportunities for figuring out how healthy bodies function and what goes wrong when they don’t. Understanding the molecular basis of health and illness also leads to more effective treatments and prevention strategies.
Because of modern biotechnology-based diagnostic techniques, we can now diagnose numerous illnesses and medical disorders more rapidly and accurately. The latest generation of home pregnancy tests, which yield more accurate results much sooner than previous tests, is perhaps the most notable example of this.
Biotechnology has become an important element of the medical world, whether it is the manufacture of genetically enhanced treatments for diseases, the strengthening of immunity against diseases, or the production of drugs and vaccines for the treatment of various diseases. Biotechnology products in human healthcare include more rapid and accurate diagnostic tests, medicines with minimal side effects, and newer and safer vaccines.
Another area of medicine where biotechnology has had a significant influence is in the reduction of diagnostic expenses.
Biotechnology has also resulted in the development of new types of genetic testing. There are about 1,000 such tests available now, many of which are for hereditary illnesses and others for disease predisposition. Other developing uses of genetic testing include predicting drug response and assisting with dietary planning.
Biotechnology, without a doubt, contributes significantly to the expanding public and global health demands. The need for biotechnology specialists has expanded dramatically as a result of Covid-19 exposing the necessity for medical professionals across numerous disciplines. People are now increasingly turning to biotechnology specialists to return their lives to normalcy, and this is where a degree in biotechnology becomes relevant.
