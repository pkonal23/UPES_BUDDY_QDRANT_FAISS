Program Details
The
B. Sc. (Hons.) in Chemistry by Research
program offered by UPES School of Advanced Engineering is a comprehensive 4-year undergraduate program in the Applied Science Cluster. The curriculum has been designed in accordance with the NEP 2020 framework, providing students with the flexibility to customize their education based on their interests and career aspirations. The program is divided into 8 semesters, with each semester offering courses totaling a maximum of 20 credits. One of the unique features of this program is the multiple exit and entry options it provides to students. After completing 40 credits in a year, students have the option to exit with a certificate in the chosen discipline. After earning 80 credits in 2 years, students can opt for a diploma. Upon completing 120 credits in three years, students are awarded a UG degree in the given discipline.
For students aiming for a more in-depth academic experience, there is an option to pursue either a B. Sc. (Hons.) degree or a B. Sc. (Hons.) by research, depending on their preferences during the 4th year of the program. The B. Sc. (Hons.) option involves advanced domain-specific courses, while the B. Sc. (Hons.) by Research option allows students to engage in extensive research and defend their thesis in front of a panel of experts in their chosen area of research.
Furthermore, the program offers elective/specialization choices in Polymer Chemistry or Industrial Chemistry, allowing students to delve deeper into their specific areas of interest. In the final year, students undergo research-specific courses to prepare them for their dissertation. Additionally, the program follows the NEP 2020 regulations, enabling lateral entry for students who may wish to join the program at a later stage. Upon completing the 4-year UG degree, students also have the opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. with coursework both in India and abroad.
