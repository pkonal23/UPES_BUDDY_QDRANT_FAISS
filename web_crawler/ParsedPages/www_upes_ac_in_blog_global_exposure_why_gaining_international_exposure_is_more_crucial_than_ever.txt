Why gaining international exposure is more crucial than ever
By a Correspondent
Published 21/07/2020
UPES offers ample opportunities for students to experience and develop a global outlook. The Department of International Affairs at UPES has meticulously chalked out avenues through which students get international exposure
Technology, with each passing day, is making the world more connected than ever. Globalization has permeated our daily lives – we eat at an American burger chain, watch German origin shows, engage with multi-cultural content on social media, and get a pleasant surprise seeing Indian customs being followed worldwide (Namaste is poised to become the preferred greeting in the new normal). New businesses are entering our market and connecting with us. In such a scenario, the need to offer students international exposure is paramount.
Global exposure, in the simplest of terms, is opening our minds to new cultures. In the context of academics, it means learning and understanding the conduct of business and/or education in a different country. The pedagogies and methodologies differ, the anticipation from a non-native is different, the rules of social behavior change, and the general perception towards life varies. When one combines such and more new layers to an ongoing process, it results in a mix of outcomes, which, more often than not, is not the desired result. To solve such a hassle is tricky. And few are skilled enough to understand the complexity and chart a route out of the confusion effectively. These few are professionals who have extensive global exposure. And the ones who go on to lead large projects and organizations.
The most significant advantage of studying internationally is learning new life skills
Here’s a rundown of three main reasons why, in this globalized economy, having international exposure is akin to having a wish-granting elixir.
Learning new rules in a new land
Imagine you are pitching to a Japanese client. You want to impress them and follow business ethics, so you decide to greet them with lilies or white carnations. Before you start painting an image of working in Tokyo, you should know the client has already rejected your (brilliant) pitch. Why? In Japanese culture, white flowers and lilies are offered during a funeral and are strictly avoided during business meetings.
Cross-cultural knowledge helps a student
in more ways than just knowing the right flower to give. It also opens up the mind to understand how a particular community perceives your business, what cultural and social values they associate it with, and what ethics they follow while conducting business. Attaining such granular knowledge about any region is relatively easy, thanks to the internet. But experiencing the small details first-hand is what makes your strategy better than your competitors. And keeps you in business!
Relationships that transcend boundaries
Networking is one of the first vital lessons students are taught. All kinds of businesses, academic collaborations, and research coordination happens as a result of a strong network. People from different regions have different perspectives to offer. For businesses, it’s a new market, and for academic institutions, it’s a new pedagogy, but for both, it’s an opportunity to expand and grow.
International exposure offers students the chance to cultivate new relations with people from different countries and offer to build a network of new perspectives and business opportunities. Today, when countries are rapidly shifting focus on domestic production and collaborating with other nations for greater efficiency, having a strong network of professionals from different regions would give you and your business a tremendous edge.
Global exposure brings unique life skills
The most significant advantage of studying internationally is learning new life skills. A new place requires a new way of living – cooking on your own, learning to communicate your message in a new language, understanding new business ethics – and this new learning goes a long way in one’s professional life as well. As mentioned earlier, knowing what a particular culture likes and dislikes is crucial in creating a business strategy and conquering a new market.
Working or studying in a new country also opens the door for a global career. One assesses you on your ability to gel up with a new set of people, and having the credentials and experience of
studying in a different country adds weight to your CV
.
UPES offers ample opportunities for students to experience and develop a global outlook. The Department of International Affairs at UPES has meticulously chalked out avenues through which students get international exposure. Student and Faculty Exchange Program and Internships offer a chance to attend another university and exchange knowledge and skills. Similarly,
the Global Immersion Program
allows students to visit reputed international universities and enroll in one of the two streams: Global Leadership and Design and Innovation. In the new normal, where students and professionals alike are starting to embrace working from home, having a comprehensive knowledge of the global business at your fingertips puts you miles ahead of your competition. At UPES, our vision is to impart world-class education and cultivate the next generation of leaders equipped with a global outlook.

The pedagogies and methodologies differ, the anticipation from a non-native is different, the rules of social behavior change, and the general perception towards life varies. When one combines such and more new layers to an ongoing process, it results in a mix of outcomes, which, more often than not, is not the desired result. To solve such a hassle is tricky. And few are skilled enough to understand the complexity and chart a route out of the confusion effectively. These few are professionals who have extensive global exposure. And the ones who go on to lead large projects and organizations.
The most significant advantage of studying internationally is learning new life skills
Here’s a rundown of three main reasons why, in this globalized economy, having international exposure is akin to having a wish-granting elixir.
Learning new rules in a new land
Imagine you are pitching to a Japanese client. You want to impress them and follow business ethics, so you decide to greet them with lilies or white carnations. Before you start painting an image of working in Tokyo, you should know the client has already rejected your (brilliant) pitch. Why? In Japanese culture, white flowers and lilies are offered during a funeral and are strictly avoided during business meetings.
Cross-cultural knowledge helps a student
in more ways than just knowing the right flower to give. It also opens up the mind to understand how a particular community perceives your business, what cultural and social values they associate it with, and what ethics they follow while conducting business. Attaining such granular knowledge about any region is relatively easy, thanks to the internet. But experiencing the small details first-hand is what makes your strategy better than your competitors. And keeps you in business!
Relationships that transcend boundaries
Networking is one of the first vital lessons students are taught. All kinds of businesses, academic collaborations, and research coordination happens as a result of a strong network. People from different regions have different perspectives to offer. For businesses, it’s a new market, and for academic institutions, it’s a new pedagogy, but for both, it’s an opportunity to expand and grow.
International exposure offers students the chance to cultivate new relations with people from different countries and offer to build a network of new perspectives and business opportunities. Today, when countries are rapidly shifting focus on domestic production and collaborating with other nations for greater efficiency, having a strong network of professionals from different regions would give you and your business a tremendous edge.
Global exposure brings unique life skills
The most significant advantage of studying internationally is learning new life skills. A new place requires a new way of living – cooking on your own, learning to communicate your message in a new language, understanding new business ethics – and this new learning goes a long way in one’s professional life as well. As mentioned earlier, knowing what a particular culture likes and dislikes is crucial in creating a business strategy and conquering a new market.
Working or studying in a new country also opens the door for a global career. One assesses you on your ability to gel up with a new set of people, and having the credentials and experience of
studying in a different country adds weight to your CV
.
UPES offers ample opportunities for students to experience and develop a global outlook. The Department of International Affairs at UPES has meticulously chalked out avenues through which students get international exposure. Student and Faculty Exchange Program and Internships offer a chance to attend another university and exchange knowledge and skills. Similarly,
the Global Immersion Program
allows students to visit reputed international universities and enroll in one of the two streams: Global Leadership and Design and Innovation. In the new normal, where students and professionals alike are starting to embrace working from home, having a comprehensive knowledge of the global business at your fingertips puts you miles ahead of your competition. At UPES, our vision is to impart world-class education and cultivate the next generation of leaders equipped with a global outlook.

Technology, with each passing day, is making the world more connected than ever. Globalization has permeated our daily lives – we eat at an American burger chain, watch German origin shows, engage with multi-cultural content on social media, and get a pleasant surprise seeing Indian customs being followed worldwide (Namaste is poised to become the preferred greeting in the new normal). New businesses are entering our market and connecting with us. In such a scenario, the need to offer students international exposure is paramount.
