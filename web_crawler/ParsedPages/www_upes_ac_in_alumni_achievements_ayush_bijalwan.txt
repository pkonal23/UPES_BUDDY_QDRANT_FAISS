Ayush Bijalwan - Achievement

Ayush Bijalwan - Achievement

Aayush Bijalwan, an alumnus of UPES' School of Design, emerged as the triumphant winner in the TVS Ntorq 125 Call of Design Season 2 by TVS Motor Company. His winning entry aligned with the comic book theme of "Rise of the Ntorqians," while maintaining TVS' iconic race-themed design philosophy for the Ntorq 125.
TVS Motor Company successfully concluded the second season of the TVS Ntorq 125 Call of Design competition, unveiling Aayush Bijalwan as the distinguished winner. A proud student of UPES design school (Dehradun), Aayush was rewarded with a brand-new TVS Ntorq 125 Race Edition, accompanied by a cash prize of Rs 30,000, in recognition of his exceptional design prowess.
The Call of Design initiative, initially launched by TVS in 2019 to enhance community relations, garnered positive feedback and prompted the commencement of its second season in August 2020. This edition, aptly named "Rise of the Ntorqians," retained the comic book and superhero theme. The competition criteria mandated designs that aligned with the comic book narrative while embodying TVS' distinct race-themed design philosophy for the Ntorq 125.
Aayush's success was attributed to his sleek and minimalist cyber design, captivating the judges and securing him the coveted first place. Notable mentions also include Abhishek Chellapandiyan from the State School of Design (Bengaluru), the first runner-up with a cash prize of Rs 30,000, and Arsh Riyaz Maknojia from MIT Institute of Design (Pune), the second runner-up who earned a cash prize of Rs 20,000. The competition encompassed additional categories, including Media and Viewer’s Choice, with winners such as Bilal Firfiray (Bikewale), Gaurav Sadanand (ZigWheels), Shoeb Kalania (Indian Autos Blog), and Oberdan Bezzi (Motoroids), each contributing to the vibrant results. The Viewer’s Choice award, determined by a vote from a pool of 15 designs, was triumphantly secured by Arsh Riyaz Maknojia.
A distinguished panel of judges from TVS Motor Company played a pivotal role in assessing and selecting the victors. Comprising senior figures such as Elias Abraham (Senior Vice President, Style, and Design, Research, and Development), Varghese M Thomas (Vice President, Corporate Communication), Aniruddha Haldar (Vice President, Marketing – Commuter Motorcycles, Scooters, and Corporate Brand), and Amit Rajwade (Head, Scooter Design, Research and Development), the panel expertly evaluated the entries, showcasing their dedication to recognizing exceptional design talent. This achievement stands as a testament to the enduring commitment of UPES' School of Design and its outstanding alumni in fostering innovation and creative excellence.
