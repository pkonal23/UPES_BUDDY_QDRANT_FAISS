The
MBA in Metaverse & Web 3.0 (Metaverse)
program at UPES is a cutting-edge offering that equips students with a comprehensive understanding of the Metaverse, blockchain, and Web 3.0 technologies. The curriculum focuses on the current state and potential future developments of the Metaverse, as well as the various business models and revenue streams that can be harnessed in this emerging domain. Students also delve into the legal and ethical considerations related to the Metaverse, addressing critical issues like privacy, intellectual property, and governance.
The program goes beyond theoretical knowledge and offers practical skills in areas such as virtual and augmented reality design and development, data management and analytics, and business strategy and planning.
