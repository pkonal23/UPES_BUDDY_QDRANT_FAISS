Profile Summary
Shatavisha Mustafi, Assistant Professor, School of Liberal Studies and Media, UPES. Mustafi was a Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral 2019-2020 fellow at the Department of Art, Theory and Criticism, MIT where her research focused on the art collection of Chester and Davida Herwitz and the role of foreign patronage in promoting Indian art overseas. Her study tracked how value-making in the ‘artworld’ is based on the economic structures that underlie the practice and circulation of art.
Shatavisha holds an undergraduate degree in Comparative Literature and has a Masters as well as an M.Phil degree in Art History. Shatavisha’s publications have appeared in the Bengal Art Journal, Sahapedia, and Eyeline. The Indian Council of Social Sciences and Research, Ministry of Education, India has recognized her work by supporting her doctoral research.
As a curator and a visual culture researcher, she co-curated the Students’ Biennale, Kochi Biennale Foundation. Her curatorial proposition explored the modern praxis of art making within the structures of the colonial art school education. Her projects leaned towards understanding the various strands of art making within the student community. Alongside her professional commitments, Shatavisha is a trained
Bharatnatyam
