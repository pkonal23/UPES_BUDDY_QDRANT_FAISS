Teaching Philosophy
Prof. Gupta’s belief in terms of teaching involves creating a conducive atmosphere which is quite permissible in terms of administered assessment as it enables students in terms of knowledge integration into a valuable framework of the learning process. The learning environment in a classroom should be accurate enough in terms of knowledge, skills impartment which in turn makes the student learning quite applicable in real-time circumstances in the future. Apart from that I firmly consider that learning-oriented education encourages learning which is very much focused.
