Profile Summary
Dr. Balwinder Singh has more than 11 years of teaching and research experience. He is an avid writer with a keen interest in contemporary issues and often publishes papers, blogs, book reviews, and case comments. He has been associated with a few NGOs that work for the welfare of women and children. His seminal work has been published in the form of books on the "Interface between Science, Technology and Human Rights," "Changing Dimensions of Family Law in the 21st Century-Challenges in Indian Perspective," and "Expanding Horizons of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution: A Critique."
Work Experience
