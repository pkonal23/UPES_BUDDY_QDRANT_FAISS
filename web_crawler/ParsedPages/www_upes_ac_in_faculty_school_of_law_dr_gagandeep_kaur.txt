Teaching Philosophy
Dr Gagandeep Kaur’s teaching philosophy is grounded in the understanding that along with theoretical knowledge of legal provisions; it is of utmost importance to incorporate natural law philosophies, values and belief in teaching so that students become more empathic lawyers and judges. She provides a set of criteria standards to judge the quality of student assignments. She believes that is her responsibility to create a climate that supports and encourages student learning. She has incorporated some elements of “flipping the classroom” into his classes such as pre-reading assignments, in which students read assigned sections of the textbook and/or other resources prior to coming to class where they complete a short quiz. Using authentic problems helps students move from novice to expert thinking.
