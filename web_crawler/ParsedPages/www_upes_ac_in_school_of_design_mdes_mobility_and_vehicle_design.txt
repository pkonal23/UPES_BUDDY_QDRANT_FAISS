Program Details
The
M.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
program offered by UPES prepares students to excel in designing innovative and sustainable transportation solutions for future mobility. By focusing on areas such as automotive design, public transportation design, mobility services, urban planning, and sustainability, students gain advanced skills in this field.
The program emphasizes both the creative and practical aspects of mobility design, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of transit technologies and current social trends. Through hands-on practice in sketching, drawing, illustrations, materials, and computer-aided design (CAD), students learn to apply their creativity to real-world projects and develop their skills. Additionally, students have the opportunity to gain valuable industry experience through internships, further enhancing their practical knowledge.
One of the key strengths of this program is its multidisciplinary approach. Students learn to work in a collaborative environment, honing their design research, creativity, and practical skills in vehicle design. They also gain proficiency in 3D digital formats, including visualizations and modelling. This combination of skills equips students to become automotive design researchers and empowers them to leverage innovation to achieve business goals. By acquiring these competencies, students can distinguish themselves in the field and establish their expertise.
Program Highlights
Students have access to cutting-edge infrastructure, including Cintiq labs, Mac lab, CAD lab, clay modelling and FRP lab, wood workshop, 3D printer, and VR lab, providing them with the necessary tools to explore and develop their design skills.
The
M.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
program focuses on providing exposure to industry-relevant software used in design disciplines, enabling students to master graphics design and effectively utilize these tools in various industries.
Through lectures, discussions, exercises, and assignments, students gain fundamental knowledge and skills required for the professional world, preparing them to enter the industry with confidence and competence.
The program collaborates with prominent corporations in the mobility and transportation industry, offering students invaluable training opportunities and exposure to the latest design technologies employed by these companies.
Students undergo training programs with well-known companies such as Maruti Suzuki Ltd., Hero Motor Corp., TVS Motors, Volvo Eicher, Volvo Bus, Kia Motors, Bajaj Auto, Ola Motors, Cyient Technology, Tata Elxsi, and Royal Enfield, providing them with real-world experiences and insights.
The M.Des. Mobility and Vehicle Design program incorporates a focus on pure EV technologies, with partnerships with Eicher Motors Chennai and Tata Elxsi Hyderabad, allowing students to gain expertise in this growing segment of the transportation industry.
Future Scope / Industry Trends
The future scope of the
M.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
program is promising and filled with opportunities. The field of transportation has evolved beyond simple conveyance, with urban transportation now emphasizing comfort, technology, durability, and speed. As a result, the industry requires skilled design experts who can develop solutions that meet present and future needs while considering technical complexities and aesthetic appeal. Pursuing a degree in this field is essential, as it provides the necessary knowledge and expertise to succeed in the rapidly expanding transportation sector. Cloud-based systems and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) are two significant developments shaping the industry, offering scalability, digital resource utilization, and integrated travel experiences. Various trends are also contributing to this shift, such as infrastructure optimization, ticketless travel platforms, multimodal transportation hubs, and innovations in last-mile connectivity and micro-mobility.
Career Opportunities
The field of transportation and mobility design presents numerous career prospects as it continues to grow rapidly. Individuals passionate about designing and improving mobility options can explore various professions within this sector. The demand for skilled professionals in this industry is increasing steadily. Those interested in pursuing a
M.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
degree have a wide range of options to choose from.
The following potential professional paths are available for students who specialize in
Mobility and Vehicle Design
.
Design Strategist
Transportation Designer

Program Details
The
M.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
program offered by UPES prepares students to excel in designing innovative and sustainable transportation solutions for future mobility. By focusing on areas such as automotive design, public transportation design, mobility services, urban planning, and sustainability, students gain advanced skills in this field.
The program emphasizes both the creative and practical aspects of mobility design, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of transit technologies and current social trends. Through hands-on practice in sketching, drawing, illustrations, materials, and computer-aided design (CAD), students learn to apply their creativity to real-world projects and develop their skills. Additionally, students have the opportunity to gain valuable industry experience through internships, further enhancing their practical knowledge.
One of the key strengths of this program is its multidisciplinary approach. Students learn to work in a collaborative environment, honing their design research, creativity, and practical skills in vehicle design. They also gain proficiency in 3D digital formats, including visualizations and modelling. This combination of skills equips students to become automotive design researchers and empowers them to leverage innovation to achieve business goals. By acquiring these competencies, students can distinguish themselves in the field and establish their expertise.
Program Highlights
Students have access to cutting-edge infrastructure, including Cintiq labs, Mac lab, CAD lab, clay modelling and FRP lab, wood workshop, 3D printer, and VR lab, providing them with the necessary tools to explore and develop their design skills.
The
M.Des. (Mobility and Vehicle Design)
program focuses on providing exposure to industry-relevant software used in design disciplines, enabling students to master graphics design and effectively utilize these tools in various industries.
Through lectures, discussions, exercises, and assignments, students gain fundamental knowledge and skills required for the professional world, preparing them to enter the industry with confidence and competence.
The program collaborates with prominent corporations in the mobility and transportation industry, offering students invaluable training opportunities and exposure to the latest design technologies employed by these companies.
Students undergo training programs with well-known companies such as Maruti Suzuki Ltd., Hero Motor Corp., TVS Motors, Volvo Eicher, Volvo Bus, Kia Motors, Bajaj Auto, Ola Motors, Cyient Technology, Tata Elxsi, and Royal Enfield, providing them with real-world experiences and insights.
