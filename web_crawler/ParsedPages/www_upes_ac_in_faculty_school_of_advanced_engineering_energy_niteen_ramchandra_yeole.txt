Mr. Niteen Ramchandra Yeole
Assistant Professor (Selection Grade)

Mr. Niteen Ramchandra Yeole

Assistant Professor (Selection Grade)

Profile Summary
Niteen Ramchandra Yeole is actively engaged in research areas such as adsorptive separations, solid-state ion exchange, regeneration and reuse of spent adsorbents, forest fire management through forest biomass utilization, utilization of cold energy of LNG at LNG regasification terminal, statistical analysis of data, and design of experiments for energy conservation. His research work primarily focuses on energy, environment, and sustainability-related issues.
Work Experience
Prior to joining UPES, Mr. Yeole held positions at the Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT), Pune, India. He also served as a visiting faculty for the subject "Fundamentals of Refining" at the International Institute of Information Technology (I2IT), Pune, offering insights to MBA (Oil & Gas) students. Furthermore, Mr. Yeole conducted a successful 5-Day Training Program on "Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units in Refineries" in Dubai, UAE, organized by "TUV Middle East" for professionals working in FCC units of petroleum refineries.
Additionally, he provided training to "L & T Employees" on various "Petroleum Refinery" related topics, such as Atmospheric & Vacuum Distillation, Fluid Catalytic Cracking, Thermal Cracking, Catalytic Reforming, Isomerization, and Lube Oil Processing, on the MIT campus.
Research Interests
Mr. Yeole's research interests lie in adsorptive separations, ion exchange, activation of spent adsorbents, air pollution control, energy management, and sustainable environment.
Teaching Philosophy
Mr. Yeole's teaching philosophy is centred around fostering subject interest among students through creative and innovative learning. He incorporates student learning and assessments using animations/video demonstrations and research papers. He strongly advocates for student assessments through open-ended and industry-based assignments, allowing students to identify industrial problems, select variables and data aligned with industrial processes, and design their own equipment with certain assumptions.
Courses Taught
Mr. Yeole has taught a wide range of Chemical Engineering subjects, including Novel Separation Processes, alongside specialized topics in upstream, midstream, and downstream domains, such as Petroleum Refining, Gas Processing, LNG & Storage of Natural Gas, and Petroleum Production System Design. He encourages students to read research papers related to the courses being taught, promoting interest in the subjects and keeping them updated with the latest developments in relevant fields.
Awards and Grants
Mr. Yeole received the First Prize Award for his Presentation entitled "Newer insights into green and low-cost zeolitic adsorbents for adsorptive desulfurization of liquid transportation fuels" at the International Conference, SuschemE 2015, organized by ICT.
Scholarly Activities
As an activity coordinator, Mr. Yeole has effectively motivated students to present their project work to the outside world and encouraged them to write research papers based on their projects, which were later published in reputed journals. Several students have also presented their work at National and International conferences, receiving valuable feedback from external experts. Mr. Yeole firmly believes in the potential of youth and aims to channel their energy and enthusiasm by imparting proper knowledge and direction, enabling them to achieve extraordinary accomplishments.
