Teaching Philosophy

Teaching Philosophy

Mr. Arvind’s teaching philosophy is based on the practical application of the law learnt in the classrooms. He encourages student learning through real-world instances and illustrations. His teaching philosophy aligns with the jurisprudential perspective that views law not merely as an abstract set of rules but as a living, breathing entity that shapes the society. He also believes in the overall development of students and consequentially regularly inspire students to participate in other activities.
