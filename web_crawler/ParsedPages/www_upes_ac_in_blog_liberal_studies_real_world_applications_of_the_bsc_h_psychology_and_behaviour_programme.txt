Real-world applications of the B.Sc. (H) Psychology and Behaviour Program
Ouroz Khan
Published 22/03/2024
Have you ever wondered why some people love spending time with friends while others feel shy talking to strangers? Why is it easier to remember a phone number with hyphens (555-1234) than without (5551234)? Or why do Apps use red colour for missed notifications? Or have you found yourself agreeing to an answer in class because everyone else did, even if you weren’t sure if it was right? These examples illustrate how psychological principles influence our daily lives. Psychology, as the scientific study of mind and behaviour, provides answers to such questions.
Some people crave social interaction, while others feel drained out by it. This difference can be explained by personality traits like introversion and extroversion. Similarly, our brains tend to group information into smaller, more manageable units, which helps in remembering information. The colour red, often associated with urgency or danger, is frequently used by Apps to grab our attention for missed notifications. Additionally, conforming to the opinions or behaviours of others in a group is an example of social influence that can lead to decisions we wouldn’t make on our own.
From learning and memory processes to social interactions, psychology offers insights into the fascinating workings of the human mind. The B.Sc. (Hons.) Psychology and Behaviour program at UPES School of Liberal Studies offers a comprehensive understanding of mental processes and human behaviour through a multidisciplinary approach. With a focus on research-led teaching, students explore various research methodologies and techniques used in psychological research, gaining practical experience in a state-of-the-art psychology lab. They engage in real-world applications, contribute to mental health awareness initiatives, and collaborate across allied fields.
The program emphasises assessment diversity and provides opportunities for internships and research projects. The highlights of this program include a student-centered learning environment using a transdisciplinary approach, training in experiment design, data analysis and exposure to training by global experts and world-renowned researchers.
A degree in B.Sc. (H) Psychology and Behaviour prepares us for diverse career opportunities, ranging from:
Clinical Psychology
where we assess, diagnose, and treat mental health disorders.
Counselling and Therapy
where we provide support and guidance to individuals facing personal challenges.
Organisational Behaviour
focuses on enhancing employee well-being and productivity in workplaces.
School education
aims at improving teaching and learning experiences, assessing student needs, and providing behavioural interventions in educational settings.
Research and Academia
provide a ground for exploring higher studies and pursuing research to unfold the intricacies of various psychological phenomenon.
Social Services and Community
Outreach
focused on addressing social issues and supporting marginalised populations.
Health and Well-Being
aims at promoting overall well-being at healthcare institutions and public health organisations as well as creates wellness programs to develop interventions encouraging healthy lifestyles.
Market Research and Consumer Behaviour
which focuses on understanding consumer behavior, conducting surveys, and interpreting data to help businesses understand customer preferences and develop effective marketing strategies.
User Experience (UX) Design
aims at creating user-friendly interfaces and experiences.
These examples illustrate the diverse career paths available to psychology graduates, highlighting the versatility and applicability of a psychology degree in addressing real-world challenges.

Have you ever wondered why some people love spending time with friends while others feel shy talking to strangers? Why is it easier to remember a phone number with hyphens (555-1234) than without (5551234)? Or why do Apps use red colour for missed notifications? Or have you found yourself agreeing to an answer in class because everyone else did, even if you weren’t sure if it was right? These examples illustrate how psychological principles influence our daily lives. Psychology, as the scientific study of mind and behaviour, provides answers to such questions.
Some people crave social interaction, while others feel drained out by it. This difference can be explained by personality traits like introversion and extroversion. Similarly, our brains tend to group information into smaller, more manageable units, which helps in remembering information. The colour red, often associated with urgency or danger, is frequently used by Apps to grab our attention for missed notifications. Additionally, conforming to the opinions or behaviours of others in a group is an example of social influence that can lead to decisions we wouldn’t make on our own.
From learning and memory processes to social interactions, psychology offers insights into the fascinating workings of the human mind. The B.Sc. (Hons.) Psychology and Behaviour program at UPES School of Liberal Studies offers a comprehensive understanding of mental processes and human behaviour through a multidisciplinary approach. With a focus on research-led teaching, students explore various research methodologies and techniques used in psychological research, gaining practical experience in a state-of-the-art psychology lab. They engage in real-world applications, contribute to mental health awareness initiatives, and collaborate across allied fields.
The program emphasises assessment diversity and provides opportunities for internships and research projects. The highlights of this program include a student-centered learning environment using a transdisciplinary approach, training in experiment design, data analysis and exposure to training by global experts and world-renowned researchers.
A degree in B.Sc. (H) Psychology and Behaviour prepares us for diverse career opportunities, ranging from:
Clinical Psychology
where we assess, diagnose, and treat mental health disorders.
Counselling and Therapy
where we provide support and guidance to individuals facing personal challenges.
Organisational Behaviour
focuses on enhancing employee well-being and productivity in workplaces.
School education
aims at improving teaching and learning experiences, assessing student needs, and providing behavioural interventions in educational settings.
