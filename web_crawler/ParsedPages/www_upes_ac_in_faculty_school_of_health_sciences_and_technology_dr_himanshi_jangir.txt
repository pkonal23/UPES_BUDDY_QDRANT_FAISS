Profile Summary
She is a bioengineer cum nature-inspired bio-designer with extensive hands-on experience in the design and manufacturing of multi-organ human-on-a-chip platforms for animal-free drug discovery, micro-physiological systems, 3-D organ printing, bio-hybrid devices, green electrode development for bioenergy devices, and nano agriculture. She did her undergraduate training in biological sciences and bioengineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2013-2017). Her undergraduate research was on carbon and cerium-based bio-electrodes. Then, she completed her master’s research (2017-2018) in the same department while working on an ISRO-funded project on novel bioinspired lithium-sulfide cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. She finished her BTech and MTech degrees with the Academic Excellence Award (2017). She joined the Department of Design at IIT Kanpur for her Doctoral research (2018-2020) and worked on nano agriculture and green electrode materials. She received the Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Award in the 53rd Convocation of IIT Kanpur. She moved to the University of Central Florida in 2020 to work on ‘Human on a Chip’ systems with 'Preeminent Postdoctoral Program (P3) Fellowship’ (2020-2024). She worked on tendon mimetic extracellular matrix, sarcopenia modelling, neuromuscular modelling of familial and sporadic ALS mutations, and development of multi-organ model to study disease comorbidities in ageing population during her tenure. In April 2024, she joined UPES as an assistant professor.
Work Experience
Post-Doctoral Fellow in Academia-Industry (September 2020- March 2024): Worked on human-on-a-chip systems at the Nanoscience Technology Center, University of Central Florida, and Hesperos Inc. Orlando, USA.
Senior Research Engineer (July 2020- January 2021): Worked on protein bio-battery at the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, IIT Kanpur, India.
COVID Project (April 2020- June 2020): Worked on a positive pressure respirator system at the Department of Design, IIT Kanpur, India.
Research Interests
Frugal technologies for cell-based biochips to screen drugs, pesticides, and cosmetics
Protein biobattery and bioelectrodes for medical applications
Sustainable food production for better health
Teaching Philosophy
As an educator in sustainable bio-design, her lifelong pursuit is learning by doing experiments. She will offer courses that aim to lay the foundation for appreciating the biological designs that already exist in nature. The core idea will be to understand the age-old natural machines and to embark on emulating these biological machines through various manufacturing approaches. The key to such manufacturing will be sustainability.
Courses Taught
Teaching assistant (2018-2024) at the National Program on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), India, she worked on the following courses:
Bioenergy
Animal Physiology
Bioelectrochemistry
Cell Culture Technologies
Nanotechnology in Agriculture
Bio-energetics of Life Processes

Profile Summary
She is a bioengineer cum nature-inspired bio-designer with extensive hands-on experience in the design and manufacturing of multi-organ human-on-a-chip platforms for animal-free drug discovery, micro-physiological systems, 3-D organ printing, bio-hybrid devices, green electrode development for bioenergy devices, and nano agriculture. She did her undergraduate training in biological sciences and bioengineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2013-2017). Her undergraduate research was on carbon and cerium-based bio-electrodes. Then, she completed her master’s research (2017-2018) in the same department while working on an ISRO-funded project on novel bioinspired lithium-sulfide cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. She finished her BTech and MTech degrees with the Academic Excellence Award (2017). She joined the Department of Design at IIT Kanpur for her Doctoral research (2018-2020) and worked on nano agriculture and green electrode materials. She received the Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Award in the 53rd Convocation of IIT Kanpur. She moved to the University of Central Florida in 2020 to work on ‘Human on a Chip’ systems with 'Preeminent Postdoctoral Program (P3) Fellowship’ (2020-2024). She worked on tendon mimetic extracellular matrix, sarcopenia modelling, neuromuscular modelling of familial and sporadic ALS mutations, and development of multi-organ model to study disease comorbidities in ageing population during her tenure. In April 2024, she joined UPES as an assistant professor.
Work Experience
Post-Doctoral Fellow in Academia-Industry (September 2020- March 2024): Worked on human-on-a-chip systems at the Nanoscience Technology Center, University of Central Florida, and Hesperos Inc. Orlando, USA.
Senior Research Engineer (July 2020- January 2021): Worked on protein bio-battery at the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, IIT Kanpur, India.
COVID Project (April 2020- June 2020): Worked on a positive pressure respirator system at the Department of Design, IIT Kanpur, India.
Research Interests
Frugal technologies for cell-based biochips to screen drugs, pesticides, and cosmetics
Protein biobattery and bioelectrodes for medical applications
Sustainable food production for better health
Teaching Philosophy
As an educator in sustainable bio-design, her lifelong pursuit is learning by doing experiments. She will offer courses that aim to lay the foundation for appreciating the biological designs that already exist in nature. The core idea will be to understand the age-old natural machines and to embark on emulating these biological machines through various manufacturing approaches. The key to such manufacturing will be sustainability.

Profile Summary
She is a bioengineer cum nature-inspired bio-designer with extensive hands-on experience in the design and manufacturing of multi-organ human-on-a-chip platforms for animal-free drug discovery, micro-physiological systems, 3-D organ printing, bio-hybrid devices, green electrode development for bioenergy devices, and nano agriculture. She did her undergraduate training in biological sciences and bioengineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2013-2017). Her undergraduate research was on carbon and cerium-based bio-electrodes. Then, she completed her master’s research (2017-2018) in the same department while working on an ISRO-funded project on novel bioinspired lithium-sulfide cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. She finished her BTech and MTech degrees with the Academic Excellence Award (2017). She joined the Department of Design at IIT Kanpur for her Doctoral research (2018-2020) and worked on nano agriculture and green electrode materials. She received the Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Award in the 53rd Convocation of IIT Kanpur. She moved to the University of Central Florida in 2020 to work on ‘Human on a Chip’ systems with 'Preeminent Postdoctoral Program (P3) Fellowship’ (2020-2024). She worked on tendon mimetic extracellular matrix, sarcopenia modelling, neuromuscular modelling of familial and sporadic ALS mutations, and development of multi-organ model to study disease comorbidities in ageing population during her tenure. In April 2024, she joined UPES as an assistant professor.

Teaching Philosophy
As an educator in sustainable bio-design, her lifelong pursuit is learning by doing experiments. She will offer courses that aim to lay the foundation for appreciating the biological designs that already exist in nature. The core idea will be to understand the age-old natural machines and to embark on emulating these biological machines through various manufacturing approaches. The key to such manufacturing will be sustainability.
