Dr. Aprajita Singh

Assistant Professor - Selection Grade

Profile Summary
Dr. Aprajita Singh is an Assistant Professor (Selection Grade) with a teaching and research focus on environmental laws. Throughout her career, she has developed a strong passion for studying environmental laws in their evolving context. She has honed her academic skills through presenting numerous research papers in the field of environmental law, participating in panel discussions, and publishing research papers. Additionally, she contributes to the Policy and Politics page of "The Daily Guardian" newspaper, where she expresses her views on topics such as virtual education and the Rule of Law. She also shares her opinions through blogs on the professional networking website LinkedIn. Furthermore, she has completed various online courses on platforms like Coursera, including "Introduction to Environment Law and Policy" by the University of North Carolina and a Harvard University EdX course on Justice, to deepen her understanding of these subjects. Currently, she is pursuing her Ph.D. in environmental tribunals with a special reference to the National Green Tribunal of India.
Work Experience

This approach brings individual responses, differences, and opinions to the forefront, fostering an appreciation for each other's perspectives and facilitating democratic interactions. This problem-solving pedagogy aligns with the law's role in resolving certain issues, and the case study method is particularly relevant as it closely resembles problem-solving approaches.

Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Aprajita Singh celebrates the individuality and distinctive contributions of each student in the classroom. As a teaching method, she encourages her students to pay attention to and reflect on certain areas of their practice. If they come to a conclusion or have an initial emotional response related to the discipline, she urges them to write about it. This approach brings individual responses, differences, and opinions to the forefront, fostering an appreciation for each other's perspectives and facilitating democratic interactions. This problem-solving pedagogy aligns with the law's role in resolving certain issues, and the case study method is particularly relevant as it closely resembles problem-solving approaches.
