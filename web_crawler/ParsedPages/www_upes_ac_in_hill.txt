Projects

Projects







Investing the Black carbon Trajectories and  radiative effects across varied Glacial Landscapes  in UK’s Himalayas
PI: Dr. Amit Awasthi, Applied Science Cluster
Understanding the variability and radiative impact of aerosols over central Himalayan region. The research combines modelling techniques, satellite observations, and field measurements to investigate the ways in which black carbon affects regional climate dynamics and interacts with glacial systems.
Sustainable Waste Solutions for Uttarkashi: A Comprehensive Plastic and Biodegradable Waste Management Approach
PI: Dr. Prashant Shukla
Integrated Waste Management System:
The project aims to implement an integrated waste management system in Uttarkashi city, encompassing waste collection, segregation, transportation, treatment, and disposal. This holistic approach ensures efficient handling of both degradable and plastic waste, reducing environmental pollution and health risks.
Community Engagement and Awareness:
Central to the project is community engagement and awareness. Through extensive awareness campaigns, educational workshops, and involvement in waste management decisions, local residents are empowered to adopt responsible waste disposal practices, contributing to a cleaner environment and improved public health.
Infrastructure Development and Capacity Building:
The project focuses on infrastructure development, including waste collection centers, recycling units, and composting facilities. Additionally, capacity building programs for waste management workers, entrepreneurs, and community members enhance skills and promote sustainable employment opportunities.
Integration of Solar Tracking Technology with Water Treatment Systems for Rural Communities in Hilly Terrain: A Design and Optimization Approach
PI:  Dr. Surajit Mondal, Electrical Cluster
To build a compact Solar Thermal Water Purification system for the rural hilly areas, Self-Sustainable Technology and villagers will be operating.
Designing and Installation of the Scheffler type Solar Collector to attain the desirable temperature, which will collect the heat from the sunlight and focus it to the targeted area where the water will absorb the heat collected and precipitate the Calcium from the water.
Design of Heat Exchange System and Filtration Chamber to remove the undesirable calcium hardness found in the drinkable spring water.
Qualitative Assessment of Geo-Sites and Geo-Heritage potential of Himalayan Region: A Geo-tourism Promotion and its Conservation.
PI: Dr. Uday Bhan , Professor & Program Lead [Energy Cluster]
The Himalyan region is full of glaciers, palaeontological, archaeological, geothermal spring, limestone caves, and mineral potential.
Main Study in this project, will explore the potentiality and future scope of geosites formed from Palaeoproterozoic to Recent (Quaternary and Holocene) within Uttrakhand Himalaya.
Through this project and study : Geotourism promotion of the Uttrakhand,  will enhance the value of the state and regional tourism industry
Early detection of flash flood and landslide using wireless sensor networks for Himalayan region
PI: Vikas Thapa, Industrial Design, School of Design
Real-time monitoring for rapid response:
Wireless sensor networks will provide continuous data on critical factors like rainfall intensity, soil moisture, and ground movement, enabling early detection of flash floods and landslides.
Improved preparedness in remote areas:
The Himalayan region often has limited infrastructure. This technology can be deployed in remote locations, offering crucial warnings where traditional monitoring systems are lacking.
Data-driven decision making:
Sensor data can be used to create real-time risk assessments, allowing authorities to take preventive measures like evacuation or road closures before a disaster strikes.
A Study of the Bhimal Fiber craft of Himalayan region and mapping opportunities for intervention in existing design and diversification of existing products for village-based communities
PI: Khushboo bharti – School of Design – communication cluster
To map the existing traditional craft of Bhimal fiber in Uttrakahand
Research and documentation of the selu bimal fiber craft of karchaa
as a community based craft
Product diversification of the craft and create a new product line using the skills and traditional knowledge of the artisans and community.

Exploration of the Himalayan hot-springs for the isolation of  industrially important thermo-enzyme producing microbes
PI: Dr Suvendu Manna, Assistant Professor - Selection Grade
Isolation, selection, and characterization of thermophilic bacteria from hot springs of Uttarakhand
Screening of isolated bacteria for industrially important thermophilic enzyme and other secondary metabolites
Understanding the biogeochemistry of the hot springs.
High Throughput screening of anti-microbial resistance from environmental samples of Doon Valley for geo-spatial mapping
PI: Dr. Piyush Kumar
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health concern worldwide, and it poses a significant threat to human, animal, and environmental health. Multiple drivers, including warming temperatures due to climate change, metals and pollutants in water bodies, pharmaceutical and industry effluents, and not just the occurrence or increased usage of antimicrobials in hospital settings, can contribute to the evolution of AMR in the environment.
Effluents and aquatic bodies are major conduits for the transmission of AMR in the environment. Our study aims to conduct high-throughput screening of AMR from various effluent and aquatic bodies in the Doon Valley, an important drainage area of several Himalayan rivers and tributaries.
Using an innovative microtiter plate-based assay and by employing an array of broad-spectrum antibiotics, we at UPES, are now rapidly screening various environmental samples to develop ‘AMR  indices’ that can be conveniently mapped geo-spatially.
Geo-spatial maps of these AMR indices will help to identify hotspots, visualize seasonal trends, patterns and transmission routes in the study area. Such an approach will inform policymakers and enable better management of AMR in the environment.
AMR surveillance in this context is crucial to obtain an understanding of the connections to be addressed by several nations by implementing national action policies based on the One Health strategy. Our preliminary findings, contribute to highlighting the increment of AMR related to different microbes with the tendency to become multidrug resistant.
