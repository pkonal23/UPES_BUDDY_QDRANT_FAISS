Mental Health and Emotional wellbeing Support
We at UPES have a well-developed team of professionals offering empathetic hands to lift students out of the pit of ambiguities, disappointments, confusion, and depression. Our full-time psychological counselor adopts a holistic approach and includes all domains of student’s life while providing group and one to one counseling. Difficulties in academics and learning are dealt with through faculty mentors. UPES is among one of the few universities that understand the student's need for a friend, guide, role model and mentor. Thus we introduced the department of Student Engagement and Experience. This team works closely with students to ensure a wide range of initiatives and activities for engaging them throughout the academic year.

Remedial Coaching
Understanding the importance of supporting the students to overcome their learning difficulties and gain confidence and interest in learning, remedial classes are planned and organized each year.
The remedial classes are therefore conducted for the students whose performance is not up to the mark i.e. for the students who secure less than 40% marks in Mid-Term Examination.
These classes help the slow learners to fill the gaps in the teaching learning process which may be due to their slow learning pace, lack of understanding, lack of motivation to practice the problems etc. and ultimately enhance their learnings and skills, resulting in improvement in their performance.
