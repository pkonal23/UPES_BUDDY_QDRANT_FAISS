Dr. Yogesh C. Gupta

Industry Fellow

Profile Summary
Professor Yogesh holds a degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT-BHU and holds a master's in business administration and a PhD in Power Engineering. With over 31 years of diverse experience, he has contributed significantly to Sustainability, Decarbonization, ESG, EIA, and Operational Excellence. He has collaborated with Corporations, Industrial Associations (FICCI), Academia, and National Projects under the Ministry of Steel & Ministry of Commerce & Industry. Professor Yogesh actively engages in technology transfer from developed nations and has authored technical articles in Scopus-indexed journals. He conducted 50+ technical training sessions for capacity building, benefiting professionals from Corporate/PSUs/Government sectors. His expertise covers Energy Conservation in areas like Power Plant, Transmission & Distribution, Steel Re-Rolling Mills, and Mining. As a key instructor on behalf of BEE, he contributed to the Refresher Course for AEAs/CEAs/CEMs in India.
Work Experience
Professor Yogesh held diverse corporate positions, encompassing roles at FICCI, UNDP, and the Ministry of Steel. Notably, he contributed for three years to a GEF/UNDP-backed initiative aimed at enhancing Energy Efficiency in India's Steel Re-rolling mills (1800 units). During this tenure, he assumed additional responsibilities as Head of Capacity Building and Training, as well as Head of Information Technology.
He successfully executed a UNIDO-funded project, focusing on enhancing productivity for Pulp & Paper SMEs in UP/Uttarakhand through Energy Efficiency improvement and process technology gap assessment.
Furthermore, Professor Yogesh played a pivotal role in a UNDP/UNIDO Turkey project. This project entailed the development of "Detailed Energy Audit Methodology manuals & check sheets" for Turkey's textile sector, followed by training industry professionals (an initiative supported by the Republic of Turkey). He also presented sessions at the Istanbul energy engineering congress.
In the past three years, Professor Yogesh received invitations from CII to serve as a jury member for the National Energy Circle Competition and National Electrical Safety and Reliability Competition. As a certified Accredited Energy Auditor, he conducted diverse M&V audits and mandatory assessments for industrial sectors including Fertilizer, Iron & steel, Pulp & Paper, and Textile. His experience extends to conducting Energy Audits, EHS audits & QMS audits (ISO 14001, 18001 & 9001).
