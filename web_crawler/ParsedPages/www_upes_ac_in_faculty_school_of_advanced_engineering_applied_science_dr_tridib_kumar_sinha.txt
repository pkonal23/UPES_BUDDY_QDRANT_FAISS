Profile Summary
Dr. Tridib Kumar Sinha is a distinguished researcher, educator, and innovator with extensive experience spanning academia and industry. A Ph.D. graduate from IIT Kharagpur and a former postdoctoral researcher at Gyeongsang National University, South Korea, he currently serves as an Associate Professor at UPES, Dehradun. His work is dedicated to advancing green and sustainable materials and energy solutions, with a particular focus on polymer-based technologies. As the co-founder of UGreen Technology, a startup incubated at Runway, UPES, Dr. Sinha spearheaded the development of a low-cost, highly efficient CO₂ capture technology. This breakthrough innovation has earned recognition from leading organizations, including the Ministry of Education (MoE), Tata Sons through the Tata Social Enterprise Challenge, and Forbes, which hailed it as one of the “Best Innovations/Startups.” Dr. Sinha’s career exemplifies the synergy between academic research and practical application. His pioneering contributions to renewable energy, green technology, and advanced materials reflect his unwavering commitment to delivering scalable, sustainable solutions for various global challenges.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES in January 2022, Dr. Tridib Kumar Sinha served as a Research Professor at the Research Center for Aircraft Parts Technology (RECAPT) at Gyeongsang National University (GNU), South Korea. During his five-year postdoctoral tenure at GNU (January 2017–2021), he specialized in developing green, biocompatible, and biodegradable polymeric composites for applications in sensors and energy harvesters. Dr. Sinha earned his Ph.D. from the Materials Science Centre, IIT Kharagpur (2011–2016), where his research focused on polymer-based artificial sensors, including electronic tongue (e-tongue) and electronic nose (e-nose) technologies. Prior to his doctoral studies, he worked as a Research Chemist at Chembiotek, Kolkata (a TCG Life Sciences enterprise), from 2008 to 2010. There, he concentrated on the synthesis of organic molecules for medicinal applications. At UPES, Dr. Sinha not only pursues his academic and research interests but also actively engages in entrepreneurial initiatives, with a particular focus on carbon dioxide capture and utilization technologies.
Research Interests
Dr. Tridib Kumar Sinha’s research centers on developing advanced materials, particularly polymers and their composites, to address pressing energy and environmental challenges. His work focuses on designing innovative materials for energy harvesters and sensors capable of harnessing renewable resources such as light, heat, and mechanical energy. He is actively engaged in creating advanced materials and technologies for artificial sensors that detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These sensors have diverse applications, including environmental monitoring and the health diagnostics of humans, plants, and animals. To tackle environmental issues caused by waste materials, Dr. Sinha works on recycling waste by developing polymer composites, including biopolymers, for applications such as energy storage. Additionally, in response to global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, he is involved in projects focused on capturing and utilizing carbon dioxide (CO₂) as a resource. His research reflects a commitment to sustainability and innovation, contributing to solutions for some of the world's most critical challenges.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Tridib Kumar Sinha views teaching as a transformative journey that extends beyond the transfer of knowledge. His philosophy emphasizes inspiring students to think critically, solve problems creatively, and apply their learning to real-world scenarios. By incorporating practical examples from natural and social contexts and adopting interdisciplinary perspectives, he effectively bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Dr. Sinha prioritizes building a strong foundation in basic concepts, understanding that it is crucial for unlocking students' potential to address complex challenges with confidence and ingenuity. He also recognizes the value of peer learning as a powerful tool to deepen understanding, encourage collaboration, and cultivate a supportive learning environment. His teaching philosophy reflects a deep commitment to nurturing ethical, competent, and innovative individuals. Dr. Sinha’s ultimate goal is to prepare students to make meaningful contributions to society, equipping them with the skills and mindset to thrive in a dynamic and interconnected world.
