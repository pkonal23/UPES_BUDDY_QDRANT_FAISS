Pariniti Singh

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Pariniti Singh is a multi-faceted educator and consultant with expertise spanning fashion, accessories, product design, graphics, and UI/UX. Her passion for sustainability extends beyond the classroom. She's channeled this enthusiasm into a sustainable furniture startup, proving that design can be both innovative and environmentally conscious.
Work Experience
Pariniti brings a diverse design background to UPES. Prior to joining, she honed her skills at DIT University, Dehradun. Her experience extends beyond academia, having served as an external jury member for the Department of Design at Banasthali University. Pariniti is also empaneled by the Ministry of Textiles' SAMARTH initiative, where she bridges the gap between traditional crafts and education by examining and assessing courses for artisans. She further enriched her experience working for Levi's in their educational division with Interior Designing and contributing her graphic design expertise to the Pratham Education Foundation, an NGO.
Research Interests
Sustainability I Fashion I Furniture I Design Management I Product Innovation I UI/UX
Teaching Philosophy
My design classroom thrives on hands-on experiences. I believe students learn best by diving into real-world problems and crafting solutions. We embark on projects that challenge them to think critically, iterate on ideas, and refine their design skills. But it's not just about the final product; I see myself as a mentor and friend, guiding them through the creative process while fostering a supportive environment where they feel comfortable taking risks and exploring their unique design voices.
Scholarly Activities
Prof. Singh has three Research Papers published in Scopus Indexed Journals and is ongoing with similar research topics and then wants to take it forward for Ph.D.
Courses Taught
Prof. Singh teaches in the Foundation Year of Design Department, catering to the students of all design disciplines.
