Why Multiple Attempts Matter?
How to Prepare for JEE Mains 2025
Tips & Tricks to Crack JEE Mains
Conclusion
The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains is one of the most competitive exams in India, opening doors to prestigious engineering colleges like the National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and eligibility for the JEE Advanced for admissions into the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Among the many questions that students ask, one that stands out is: “How many attempts can I make for JEE Mains 2025?”
In this blog, we’ll  provide a detailed answer to this question while also delving into the history of JEE, the changes over the years, preparation strategies, and tips to help you succeed.
A Brief History of JEE
The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) has evolved significantly over the years:
Pre-2013:
The exam was divided into two parts – AIEEE (All India Engineering Entrance Examination) for NITs and state engineering colleges, and IIT-JEE for IITs.
2013 Onwards:
AIEEE and IIT-JEE were merged into a single two-tier system: JEE Mains and JEE Advanced.
2021 Update:
JEE Mains began to be conducted four times a year, providing students with more flexibility.
2024 Format:
JEE Mains 2025 will be conducted in two sessions: January and April.
This evolution highlights how JEE has adapted to the changing needs of students, making the exam process more inclusive and manageable.
Changes in JEE Mains Over the Years
JEE has undergone several changes to streamline the admission process:
Introduction of Computer-Based Testing (CBT):
The exam is now conducted online to ensure fairness and transparency.
Increased Attempts:
From a single yearly exam to multiple sessions, giving students ample opportunities to excel.
Syllabus Weightage:
While NCERT remains the foundation, the emphasis on application-based questions has increased.
How Many Attempts for JEE Mains 2025?
The
National Testing Agency (NTA)
, which conducts JEE Mains, allows candidates:
Two sessions per year (January and April).
Three consecutive years of eligibility.
This means a student can attempt JEE Mains 6 times in total over 3 years.
For example:
A student completing Class 12 in 2024 can appear for JEE Mains in 2024, 2025, and 2026.
For each year, they have
two attempts
(January and April).
Why Multiple Attempts Matter
Flexibility:
If one session doesn't go as planned, you can appear for the next without waiting for an entire year.
Improved Scores:
Students often perform better in their second or third attempt as they become familiar with the exam pattern.
Selection of Best Score:
The NTA considers your best score among all attempts for admissions.
Benefits of Multiple Attempts in JEE Mains
Improved Performance:
The first attempt serves as practice; the second lets you showcase your best potential.
Reduced Pressure:
Knowing you have another chance reduces exam anxiety.
Higher Success Rates:
Statistically, students who appear for both sessions have higher chances of clearing JEE Advanced.
How to Prepare for JEE Mains 2025

Conclusion
The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains is one of the most competitive exams in India, opening doors to prestigious engineering colleges like the National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and eligibility for the JEE Advanced for admissions into the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Among the many questions that students ask, one that stands out is: “How many attempts can I make for JEE Mains 2025?”
In this blog, we’ll  provide a detailed answer to this question while also delving into the history of JEE, the changes over the years, preparation strategies, and tips to help you succeed.
A Brief History of JEE
The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) has evolved significantly over the years:
Pre-2013:
The exam was divided into two parts – AIEEE (All India Engineering Entrance Examination) for NITs and state engineering colleges, and IIT-JEE for IITs.
2013 Onwards:
AIEEE and IIT-JEE were merged into a single two-tier system: JEE Mains and JEE Advanced.
2021 Update:
JEE Mains began to be conducted four times a year, providing students with more flexibility.
2024 Format:
JEE Mains 2025 will be conducted in two sessions: January and April.
This evolution highlights how JEE has adapted to the changing needs of students, making the exam process more inclusive and manageable.
Changes in JEE Mains Over the Years
JEE has undergone several changes to streamline the admission process:
Introduction of Computer-Based Testing (CBT):
The exam is now conducted online to ensure fairness and transparency.
Increased Attempts:
From a single yearly exam to multiple sessions, giving students ample opportunities to excel.
Syllabus Weightage:
While NCERT remains the foundation, the emphasis on application-based questions has increased.
How Many Attempts for JEE Mains 2025?
The
National Testing Agency (NTA)
, which conducts JEE Mains, allows candidates:
Two sessions per year (January and April).
Three consecutive years of eligibility.
This means a student can attempt JEE Mains 6 times in total over 3 years.
For example:
A student completing Class 12 in 2024 can appear for JEE Mains in 2024, 2025, and 2026.
For each year, they have
two attempts
(January and April).
Why Multiple Attempts Matter
Flexibility:
If one session doesn't go as planned, you can appear for the next without waiting for an entire year.
Improved Scores:
Students often perform better in their second or third attempt as they become familiar with the exam pattern.
Selection of Best Score:
The NTA considers your best score among all attempts for admissions.
Benefits of Multiple Attempts in JEE Mains
Improved Performance:
The first attempt serves as practice; the second lets you showcase your best potential.
Reduced Pressure:
Knowing you have another chance reduces exam anxiety.
Higher Success Rates:
Statistically, students who appear for both sessions have higher chances of clearing JEE Advanced.
