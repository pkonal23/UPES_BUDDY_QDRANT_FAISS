Course Overview
About LL.M. Courses
A postgraduate law degree gives students an in-depth insight into the vast modern legal landscape. Students can familiarise themselves with the workings of the law industry and can also specialise in an area of interest.
LL.M. course subjects cover all the essential knowledge, concepts, and principles related to the field. The wide range of specialisations comes with its own set of curricula modelled after the needs of each sector. Hence, Master of Laws with specialisation in Energy Law will differ from the learnings obtained from an LL.M. degree in International Economic Law.
LL.M. colleges in Uttarakhand such as UPES offer students a strong platform to build a professional career in law. Along with having industry experts on advisory board, the university also remains the first to be awarded the QS Five-Stars Global Rating for employability in 2016.
There are four LL.M. programs in UPES that students can enrol for which are industry-aligned specialisations. These courses shared below are sector-specific and designed as per current developments in the field.
LL.M. - Environmental and Energy Law
LL.M. - Corporate and Commercial law
LL.M. - Cybersecurity and Digital Law
LL.M. - Intellectual Property Rights
LL.M. - Alternate Dispute Resolution
LL.M. Specialisation
Core
Specialisation
LL.M.
Environmental and Energy Law
Corporate and Commercial law

LL.M. Career Prospects
LL.M. programs at UPES offer both theoretical and practical knowledge into specific areas of law, making one applicable for numerous job roles in their selected domain. The university had a 94% placement rate in the past year, where students found employment with top names such as Fox Mandal, Larsen & Toubro, IBM, Bosch and many more.
With the massive exposure that LL.M. in Uttarakhand offers, students can go for a variety of job roles in sectors ranging from law firms to corporate houses, media firms, and public organisations. Some popular roles that students can consider are:
Criminal lawyer: This job role requires one to defend someone who has been accused of committing a crime. This means carefully putting facts and figures together and articulating it to the court for the criminal to be tried.
Legal researcher: The job of a legal researcher requires in-depth studying of laws and legal articles. One can be required to research cases or customer intellectual property to support what the lawyer wants to present in court.
Legal writer: Those with a flair for writing can take up this job role that requires assisting clients in creating legal briefs, contracts, and documents.
Corporate lawyer: There is a lot of legal work involved in corporates such as contracting, acquisition, and assuring that various rights and decrees are in due accordance. Corporate lawyers take care of all such legal formalities and ensure a smooth undertaking.
