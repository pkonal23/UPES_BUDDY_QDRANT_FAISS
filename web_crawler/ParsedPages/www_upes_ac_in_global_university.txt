Global University

Overview
The university’s international collaborations for international credit transfer, semester exchange, semester abroad, and virtual programs are designed to unlock the student's potential and foster a globally-inclusive and interconnected academic community that prioritises cross-cultural learning and understanding. We strive to empower our students, faculty, and staff to engage in meaningful international experiences, collaborations and partnerships.
At UPES, we believe that every student and staff should have an opportunity to gain international exposure. We intend to achieve this through international student mobility, hosting international faculty and thought leaders at the UPES campus, promoting online collaboration between students of various institutes and universities, promoting joint research between faculties, increasing institutional collaboration through MoU and participating in international academic events.
The Department of International Affairs (DIA) supports student mobility from and to UPES. International exposure helps enhance the student's personal growth as they become competent in tackling various challenges during the journey. At UPES Global Mobility Desk, students experience world class services on their Global Journey. Learning by living in a new culture comes with its own challenges; overcoming them increases one’s confidence and belief in one’s abilities. This helps students acquire knowledge in worldly matters, which is extremely important in today’s dynamic world. UPES has collaborated with top-ranking universities across the globe to provide the best education experience to our students. With more than 50 partner universities across the globe and 4 active associations with international bodies, UPES provides excellent exchange opportunities.
