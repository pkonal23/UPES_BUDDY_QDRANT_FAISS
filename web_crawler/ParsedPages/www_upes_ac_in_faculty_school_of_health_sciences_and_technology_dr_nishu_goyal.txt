Dr. Nishu Goyal

Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Nishu Goyal is an Associate Professor in the Department of Allied Health Sciences, School of Health Sciences and Technology, UPES, Dehradun. Following a B.Tech in Biotechnology from Indraprastha University, Nishu earned her M.Tech in Biomedical Engineering from IIT Bombay and a Ph.D. in Systems Biology from NUS Singapore. Before joining PhD, she gained valuable work experience in Strand Life Sciences Pvt Ltd., a leading bioinformatics company in Bangalore, India. She was awarded the highly prestigious President Graduate Fellowship for her doctoral studies at NUS and honored with the Springer Thesis award for outstanding doctoral work. Given the global issue of increasing CO2 emissions and a need for sustainable energy, she decided to focus on the possibility of converting carbon dioxide into a cleaner energy fuel, such as methane, via biochemical pathways. To this end, she conducted an exhaustive search and identified the potential of M. maripaludis to convert CO2 to methane. Presently, her research group focuses on developing genome-scale metabolic models of microorganisms and applying them for bioremediation and clinical benefits, such as optimizing pesticide degradation pathways in soil microorganisms and identification/enhancement of antitumor agents secreted by bacteria, respectively.
Work Experience
Associate Professor (May 2023 onwards), University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India
Assistant Professor – Selection Grade (July 2017-April 2023), University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India
Research Engineer (Jan 2016-Jan 2017), Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore
Graduate Research Scholar (2011-2015), Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore
Scientist-II (2010-2011), Strand Life Sciences Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, India
Research Interests
Metabolic Model reconstruction, phenotype prediction and analysis
Novel microbial strain development and optimization for environmental remediation
Biofuels and bioenergy
Bacteria mediated disease treatment
Teaching Philosophy
For teaching, I am dedicated to share my knowledge / expertise with students, create collaborative interdisciplinary environment, guiding them on research projects, and making them self-reliant for the betterment of society. As a faculty at UPES, I interacted with many students and encouraged them to higher studies, guided them on research projects, taught/graded various subjects, and demonstrated lab experiments. I realized that students learn better if we use a learner-centredness approach. Class discussion, peer interaction, timely feedback, and updated curriculum and teaching methods are necessary. Assignments and presentations are great teaching ways to inculcate team spirit and togetherness among the students. Project-based learning and activities based on syllabus boost student aptitude, problem-solving skills, and time management and is more effective than teaching from a textbook.
Courses Taught
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Biochemistry and Metabolic Engineering, Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Introduction to Biotechnology, Fermentation Technology, Food Microbiology, Biology for Engineers, Engineering Chemistry

Profile Summary
Dr. Nishu Goyal is an Associate Professor in the Department of Allied Health Sciences, School of Health Sciences and Technology, UPES, Dehradun. Following a B.Tech in Biotechnology from Indraprastha University, Nishu earned her M.Tech in Biomedical Engineering from IIT Bombay and a Ph.D. in Systems Biology from NUS Singapore. Before joining PhD, she gained valuable work experience in Strand Life Sciences Pvt Ltd., a leading bioinformatics company in Bangalore, India. She was awarded the highly prestigious President Graduate Fellowship for her doctoral studies at NUS and honored with the Springer Thesis award for outstanding doctoral work. Given the global issue of increasing CO2 emissions and a need for sustainable energy, she decided to focus on the possibility of converting carbon dioxide into a cleaner energy fuel, such as methane, via biochemical pathways. To this end, she conducted an exhaustive search and identified the potential of M. maripaludis to convert CO2 to methane. Presently, her research group focuses on developing genome-scale metabolic models of microorganisms and applying them for bioremediation and clinical benefits, such as optimizing pesticide degradation pathways in soil microorganisms and identification/enhancement of antitumor agents secreted by bacteria, respectively.
Work Experience
Associate Professor (May 2023 onwards), University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India
Assistant Professor – Selection Grade (July 2017-April 2023), University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India
Research Engineer (Jan 2016-Jan 2017), Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore
Graduate Research Scholar (2011-2015), Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore
Scientist-II (2010-2011), Strand Life Sciences Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, India
Research Interests
Metabolic Model reconstruction, phenotype prediction and analysis
Novel microbial strain development and optimization for environmental remediation
Biofuels and bioenergy
Bacteria mediated disease treatment
Teaching Philosophy
For teaching, I am dedicated to share my knowledge / expertise with students, create collaborative interdisciplinary environment, guiding them on research projects, and making them self-reliant for the betterment of society. As a faculty at UPES, I interacted with many students and encouraged them to higher studies, guided them on research projects, taught/graded various subjects, and demonstrated lab experiments. I realized that students learn better if we use a learner-centredness approach. Class discussion, peer interaction, timely feedback, and updated curriculum and teaching methods are necessary. Assignments and presentations are great teaching ways to inculcate team spirit and togetherness among the students. Project-based learning and activities based on syllabus boost student aptitude, problem-solving skills, and time management and is more effective than teaching from a textbook.
Courses Taught

Teaching Philosophy
For teaching, I am dedicated to share my knowledge / expertise with students, create collaborative interdisciplinary environment, guiding them on research projects, and making them self-reliant for the betterment of society. As a faculty at UPES, I interacted with many students and encouraged them to higher studies, guided them on research projects, taught/graded various subjects, and demonstrated lab experiments. I realized that students learn better if we use a learner-centredness approach. Class discussion, peer interaction, timely feedback, and updated curriculum and teaching methods are necessary. Assignments and presentations are great teaching ways to inculcate team spirit and togetherness among the students. Project-based learning and activities based on syllabus boost student aptitude, problem-solving skills, and time management and is more effective than teaching from a textbook.
