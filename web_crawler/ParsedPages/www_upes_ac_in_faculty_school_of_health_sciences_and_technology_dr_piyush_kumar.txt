Profile Summary
Dr. Piyush Kumar has done Ph.D. Biochemistry and after that, joined as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Chemical Biology lab at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India, to work on Aptamer-based diagnostics of pathogenic bacteria, their toxins, and xenobiotic molecules like urea, anionic detergent pesticides, and antibiotics; nanoparticles and natural products based non-antibiotic combinatorial antibacterial therapies; and molecular and biophysical characterization and therapeutic applications of probiotic enzymes (phytase, laccase, asparaginase, etc.). Dr. Kumar has publications in journals of international repute like Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemicals, Bioresource Technology, International Journal of Biological Macromolecules, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, etc.

Research Interests
Dr. Piyush carries expertise in the areas of Aptamer generation, Nanodiagnostics, Nanobiointerfaces for various healthcare applications, Nonantibiotics based combinatorial strategy to tackle anti-microbial resistance (AMR), and Probiotic enzyme technology.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Piyush considers learning more than reading and understanding the assigned topic and being able to repeat it. Students will likely need help identifying the key concepts or carefully examining their prior knowledge. So, a teacher should act as a facilitator to identify such key concepts and can lead the initial discussion. One such essential aspect of the successful discussion is letting the students ask more questions. During his interactive discussions with students, He make literature learning enjoyable through use of models, learning by mistakes, PowerPoint presentations and animated videos to explain the concept more effectively that leads a long-lasting memory in students. He believes a teacher should ask exploratory questions that lead students to examine their prior knowledge, rephrase questions, direct the discussion to develop concepts, relate the problems surrounding them, and find out the possible solution(s) with new or already developed technologies in science. Moreover, above all, his prime concern is ensuring that everyone in the class participates and learns the material.
Courses Taught

Work Experience
Prior to joining UPES, Dr. Piyush was working as a Postdoctoral fellow at IIT Roorkee and as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biochemistry, Central University of Haryana, Mahendergarh Haryana, India.
Research Interests
Dr. Piyush carries expertise in the areas of Aptamer generation, Nanodiagnostics, Nanobiointerfaces for various healthcare applications, Nonantibiotics based combinatorial strategy to tackle anti-microbial resistance (AMR), and Probiotic enzyme technology.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Piyush considers learning more than reading and understanding the assigned topic and being able to repeat it. Students will likely need help identifying the key concepts or carefully examining their prior knowledge. So, a teacher should act as a facilitator to identify such key concepts and can lead the initial discussion. One such essential aspect of the successful discussion is letting the students ask more questions. During his interactive discussions with students, He make literature learning enjoyable through use of models, learning by mistakes, PowerPoint presentations and animated videos to explain the concept more effectively that leads a long-lasting memory in students. He believes a teacher should ask exploratory questions that lead students to examine their prior knowledge, rephrase questions, direct the discussion to develop concepts, relate the problems surrounding them, and find out the possible solution(s) with new or already developed technologies in science. Moreover, above all, his prime concern is ensuring that everyone in the class participates and learns the material.
Courses Taught
Biochemistry, Biophysics, Genetic Engineering, Bioanalytical Techniques, Bioenergetics, and Enzyme Technology, Nanobiotechnology, Proteomics and Protein Engineering, Cell Biology, Bioinformatics, Nutritional Biochemistry, Molecular and Nanodiagnostics, Diagnostic Microbiology.

Dr. Piyush carries expertise in the areas of Aptamer generation, Nanodiagnostics, Nanobiointerfaces for various healthcare applications, Nonantibiotics based combinatorial strategy to tackle anti-microbial resistance (AMR), and Probiotic enzyme technology.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Piyush considers learning more than reading and understanding the assigned topic and being able to repeat it. Students will likely need help identifying the key concepts or carefully examining their prior knowledge. So, a teacher should act as a facilitator to identify such key concepts and can lead the initial discussion. One such essential aspect of the successful discussion is letting the students ask more questions. During his interactive discussions with students, He make literature learning enjoyable through use of models, learning by mistakes, PowerPoint presentations and animated videos to explain the concept more effectively that leads a long-lasting memory in students. He believes a teacher should ask exploratory questions that lead students to examine their prior knowledge, rephrase questions, direct the discussion to develop concepts, relate the problems surrounding them, and find out the possible solution(s) with new or already developed technologies in science. Moreover, above all, his prime concern is ensuring that everyone in the class participates and learns the material.
Courses Taught

Work Experience
Prior to joining UPES, Dr. Piyush was working as a Postdoctoral fellow at IIT Roorkee and as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biochemistry, Central University of Haryana, Mahendergarh Haryana, India.
Research Interests
Dr. Piyush carries expertise in the areas of Aptamer generation, Nanodiagnostics, Nanobiointerfaces for various healthcare applications, Nonantibiotics based combinatorial strategy to tackle anti-microbial resistance (AMR), and Probiotic enzyme technology.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Piyush considers learning more than reading and understanding the assigned topic and being able to repeat it. Students will likely need help identifying the key concepts or carefully examining their prior knowledge. So, a teacher should act as a facilitator to identify such key concepts and can lead the initial discussion. One such essential aspect of the successful discussion is letting the students ask more questions. During his interactive discussions with students, He make literature learning enjoyable through use of models, learning by mistakes, PowerPoint presentations and animated videos to explain the concept more effectively that leads a long-lasting memory in students. He believes a teacher should ask exploratory questions that lead students to examine their prior knowledge, rephrase questions, direct the discussion to develop concepts, relate the problems surrounding them, and find out the possible solution(s) with new or already developed technologies in science. Moreover, above all, his prime concern is ensuring that everyone in the class participates and learns the material.
Courses Taught

Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Piyush considers learning more than reading and understanding the assigned topic and being able to repeat it. Students will likely need help identifying the key concepts or carefully examining their prior knowledge. So, a teacher should act as a facilitator to identify such key concepts and can lead the initial discussion. One such essential aspect of the successful discussion is letting the students ask more questions. During his interactive discussions with students, He make literature learning enjoyable through use of models, learning by mistakes, PowerPoint presentations and animated videos to explain the concept more effectively that leads a long-lasting memory in students. He believes a teacher should ask exploratory questions that lead students to examine their prior knowledge, rephrase questions, direct the discussion to develop concepts, relate the problems surrounding them, and find out the possible solution(s) with new or already developed technologies in science. Moreover, above all, his prime concern is ensuring that everyone in the class participates and learns the material.
