Overview

Overview

UPES launched its flagship project ‘Runway,’ a Start-up Incubator Program in 2021 that works with start-ups within and outside the university. It nurtures ideas, provides funding, and helps them transition into strong, scalable, and successful businesses, thereby preparing students not just to be job seekers but job creators as well. Over 250 start-ups have been incubated at Runway since its launch in 2021, and more than INR 20 crore in funding has been raised so far. Recently, Runway launched cohort 4.0, with 100 start-ups pre-incubated in this cohort alone. UPES has also received an INR 5 crore grant under NIDHI i-TBI (Inclusive-Tech Business Incubator).
