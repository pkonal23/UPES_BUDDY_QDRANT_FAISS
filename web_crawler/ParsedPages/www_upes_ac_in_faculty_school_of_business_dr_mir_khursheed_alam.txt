Assistant Professor - Senior Scale

Profile Summary
Dr. Mir Khursheed Alam holds a Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, India. He obtained a master's (Economics) and bachelor's (Economics, Statistics, and English) degrees from the University of Kashmir, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir. He qualified for UGC-NET and J&K-SLET in Economics. Mir Khursheed Alam's research lies in the domain of the economics of climate change and adaptation. His research interests aim to assess climate risks by incorporating hazard, vulnerability, and exposure components; socio-environmental vulnerability; and agricultural adaptation in the Himalayan Region. He carried out district-level climate vulnerability and its geospatial analysis; and identified the highly vulnerable and vulnerable-hotspots in the Indian Himalayan region. Currently, his research attempts to understand the relationships between climate risks (emanating from changing climatic conditions and extreme weather events); perception, and adaptation behaviour of the farming community in the Western Indian Himalayan region (W-IHR) at the household level, and investigate the key determinants and barriers of the adaptation process in various agro-ecological zones in Kashmir Valley.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Dr. Mir Khursheed Alam was posted as Assistant Professor in Economics, at Presidency University, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. Also, during his PhD at Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, India, he served as a teaching assistant.

His research interests aim to assess climate risks by incorporating hazard, vulnerability, and exposure components; socio-environmental vulnerability; and agricultural adaptation in the Himalayan Region. He carried out district-level climate vulnerability and its geospatial analysis; and identified the highly vulnerable and vulnerable-hotspots in the Indian Himalayan region. Currently, his research attempts to understand the relationships between climate risks (emanating from changing climatic conditions and extreme weather events); perception, and adaptation behaviour of the farming community in the Western Indian Himalayan region (W-IHR) at the household level, and investigate the key determinants and barriers of the adaptation process in various agro-ecological zones in Kashmir Valley.
