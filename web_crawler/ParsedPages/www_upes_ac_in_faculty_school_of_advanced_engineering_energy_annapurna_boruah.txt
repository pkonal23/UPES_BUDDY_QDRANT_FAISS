Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Annapurna Boruah is a renowned academician, geoscientist, energy explorationist, and sociopreneur. She completed her undergraduate degree at Gauhati University in Assam. She has completed her master’s and Ph.D degree from M S University of Baroda, and her post-doctoral (CER) from IIT Kharagpur. With over ten years of experience in research and academia, she has cultivated expertise in a wide range of areas including CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage), petroleum exploration, basin modelling, Himalayan tectonics, earth sciences, and energy transition. Her research findings have been disseminated through research publications by reputed publishers, including Nature Publisher. She is involved in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG)'s "i-HAV" initiative. Dr. Boruah's achievements have been recognised widely. She was prominently featured on the cover of the January 2020 issue of "Drilling and Exploration World" magazine, celebrated as an inspirational figure within the oil and gas industry.
In addition to her academic pursuits, Dr. Annapurna is also Nitya Visharad in Sattriya classical dance, a national-level folk dancer, a state-level debater, and a classical singer. She is also the founder of the start-up ENXARTH.
Work Experience
