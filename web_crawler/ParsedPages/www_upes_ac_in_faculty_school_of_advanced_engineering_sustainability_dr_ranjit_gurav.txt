Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Ranjit Gurav is an Associate Professor who ranks among the top 2% of global scientists in Biotechnology, Environmental Sciences, and Enabling & Strategic Technologies. Renowned for his impactful and award-winning contributions, his research centers on bioenergy, biochar, biopolymers, biomass valorization, water treatment, and bioelectrochemical systems. He has conducted extensive research across multiple countries, including the USA, South Korea, India, and China for a decade to propel advancements in his field. Dr. Gurav has effectively obtained research funding amounting to 100K USD from prestigious institutions including the NSF I-Corps of the USA, FIAP of Texas State University, USA, and the Fastrack YS of SERB, India. He has published 117 Scopus-indexed international articles and 4 international patents. He is also serving as associate editor, and topic editor to 8 international journals and a reviewer for 60 international journals. In his approach, he emphasizes the importance of integrating sustainable practices into technological innovation, ensuring that progress aligns with the principles of environmental conservation, social responsibility, and economic viability.
Work Experience
He has a decade of national and international experience, has worked in various countries including the USA, South Korea, India, and China for his professional endeavors. Before joining UPES, Dr. Gurav contributed as a Postdoctoral Associate at Texas State University, TX, USA.

Through these principles, he strive to cultivate independent, resilient learners ready to navigate the challenges.
Courses Taught
He has held positions at Texas State University in USA, Konkuk University in South Korea, Nankai University in China, and Shivaji University in India, focusing on bioenergy, biopolymers, biomass valorization, bioremediation, and water treatment technologies. His teaching passions encompass environmental engineering, biotechnology, and microbiology. Dr. Gurav has guided students undertaking research projects for MS in Environmental Engineering, M.Sc. in Biotechnology, and B.E. in Biotechnology. Additionally, he has actively participated in student training, project mentoring, and internship coordination.
Awards and Grants
He has been honored with the Young Scientist award from the Science and Engineering Research Board of India, as well as the Brain Pool Research Fellowship from Konkuk University in Seoul, South Korea. In both 2022 and 2023, he was acknowledged among the top 2% of scientists globally according to the Scopus database published by Stanford University, USA. Additionally, he received UGC-BSR and CSIR-SRF fellowships during his Ph.D. dissertation. Dr. Gurav has successfully obtained research grants totaling 100K USD from prestigious institutions including the National Science Foundation's I-Corps of the USA, the Faculty Innovation Accelerator Program (FIAP) of Texas State University, USA, and the Fastrack Young Scientist Award of the Science and Engineering Research Board in India.
Scholarly Activities
He maintains active collaborations with institutions and universities across the USA, South Korea, China, Finland, Sweden, Australia, Canada, Vietnam, and India. He has been recognized with regional and national I-corps grants from the NSF, USA, for his involvement in startup ventures as an Entrepreneurial Lead. Accumulating grants totaling 100K USD from both USA and Indian government-funded projects, he has demonstrated his commitment to advancing research endeavors. With a publication record comprising 117 articles in esteemed Scopus-indexed journals and books, Dr. Gurav has also obtained three Korean patents and one USA patent. Additionally, he is also serving as an Associate Editor for two international journals, and topical Editor for six international journals, and a reviewer for sixty international journals. Dr. Gurav is a life member of the Biotech Research Society of India (BRSI), and the Association of Microbiologists of India (AMI).
