Alind is an Assistant Professor (Law) at UPES, Dehradun. He completed his B.A.LL.B (Hons.) from National Law University, Delhi (NLUD) and LL.M. (General) from National Law School of India University, Bengaluru (NLSIU). He developed a keen interest in teaching during his 3-year stint with the NLU-Delhi Chapter of Increasing Diversity by Increasing Access (IDIA), an organization that seeks to make legal education more inclusive. His work with IDIA, along with the experience of being taught by some of India’s finest teachers, encouraged him to undertake teaching as a profession to bring a meaningful change in society.

Research Interests
Constitutional Law | Criminal Law | Law and Psychology | Jurisprudence
Teaching Philosophy
Embracing a diverse range of teaching approaches including lectures, worksheets, case-based learning, etc., he firmly believes that the true worth of knowledge lies in its intrinsic value, rather than its instrumental benefits. As a young educator, Alind tries to foster a culture in which students are comfortable in asking questions. While navigating through complex concepts, he attempts to link them with everyday examples to ensure sustainable learning.
Courses Taught
Alind is currently teaching a course on Transfer of Property and Easement Law.
