UPES-KPMG Collaboration Powers Industry-Ready Learning For Management Students
Suryansh Gaur
Published 08/07/2024
In today’s rapidly changing business environment, the demand for strategic thinking and advanced analytics has never been more critical. Addressing this need, UPES and KPMG in India have joined forces to create a pioneering partnership. Together, they have co-designed and co-delivered two specialised MBA program at the School of Business: MBA Strategy and Consulting, and MBA Business Analytics. This collaboration leverages the strengths of both institutions by merging UPES's solid educational foundation with KPMG's industry expertise. The result is a transformative business education experience that blends academic rigour with practical expertise, preparing the next generation of leaders with essential skills for the future. Graduates of these program receive an MBA degree from UPES, accompanied by a certificate from KPMG India.
Innovative MBA Program
MBA Strategy and Consulting
The MBA in Strategy and Consulting, co-delivered by UPES and KPMG India, features an innovative curriculum that tackles today’s business challenges. The program covers key areas such as problem-solving, hypothesis development, data gathering, and strategic storytelling. Additionally, it includes advanced topics like business and financial modelling, essential for any aspiring consultant. What sets this program apart is its hands-on approach, exemplified by the KPMG Consulting Capstone Experience. This unique module engages students in real-life consulting projects, providing an in-depth view of the consultant's journey from their academic phase. This approach not only enhances learning but also ensures that students are well-prepared to tackle the complexities of the business world with confidence.
Talking about the collaboration, Dr. Sunil Barthwal, Professor (Marketing), Proctor, UPES School of Business, stated, “The vision for designing MBA Strategy and Consulting program in collaboration with KPMG was to create professionals for the future needs of the corporate and society. The use of innovative pedagogy, technological interventions, and AI tools, makes this program one of the most versatile and sought after to create industry-ready professionals.”
MBA Business Analytics
Parallelly, the MBA in Business Analytics program is designed to meet the rising demand for technical expertise within business contexts. The curriculum ranges from introductory courses in business analytics and business intelligence to specialised studies in predictive modelling and machine learning. This program is meticulously designed to develop proficiency in big data, data engineering, and cloud computing—skills highly valued in today’s data-driven economy. The capstone project in this program mirrors real-world business scenarios, challenging students to apply their knowledge to achieve tangible business outcomes. This practical approach ensures that graduates not only understand the theories but can effectively implement them in diverse professional settings.
Bridging the Gap Between Academia and Industry
The World Economic Forum's 2021 findings suggest graduates with industry-linked programs are 30% more likely to secure employment within 6 months of graduation. Industry-academia partnerships are required to impart practical and relevant learning to catalyse growth and safeguard against challenging scenarios, making graduates highly skilled and employable.
Experts from KPMG in India are integral to these programs, enriching the classroom with their extensive knowledge and experience. They teach specialised modules and present case studies, effectively connecting academic theory with real-world practice. Students have the unique opportunity to learn from seasoned professionals through both face-to-face and virtual lectures, gaining insights typically accessible only within the industry.
The program includes targeted training on CV writing and interview preparation, crucial for MBA graduates. This comprehensive educational approach ensures that students are not just academically skilled but also prepared to thrive in competitive job markets. Personalised career counselling, internships, and placement services help bridge the gap between education and employment.
Elaborating on the impact of the industry-driven MBA,
Digvijay Pratap Singh, an MBA student in Strategy and Consulting (batch of 2023-25)
, said, “The MBA in Strategy and Consulting from the School of Business, UPES, equipped me with distinctive skills through a dynamic, industry-focused curriculum delivered by the faculty and invaluable in-person training from seasoned KPMG experts. The seamless integration of core knowledge with practical application in this program has ensured I am thoroughly prepared and industry ready.”
Both UPES and KPMG in India have an aggressive approach to business education. Both institutions are setting a new standard for academic excellence and industry relevance by co-designing and co-delivering these MBA program. This collaboration perfectly aligns the theoretical depth of academic learning with the practical dynamics of industry experience. Students enrolled in these programs get access to great expertise and learning opportunities that will enable them to become strategic consultants and analytics experts of tomorrow.
In conclusion, this partnership is more than just an academic venture; it’s a visionary initiative to navigate the complexities of the global business environment. Thanks to the holistic education provided by UPES and the practical insights from KPMG India, the impact of such educational innovations will surely be felt not just in India but across the global business landscape.

Graduates of these program receive an MBA degree from UPES, accompanied by a certificate from KPMG India.
Innovative MBA Program
MBA Strategy and Consulting
The MBA in Strategy and Consulting, co-delivered by UPES and KPMG India, features an innovative curriculum that tackles today’s business challenges. The program covers key areas such as problem-solving, hypothesis development, data gathering, and strategic storytelling. Additionally, it includes advanced topics like business and financial modelling, essential for any aspiring consultant. What sets this program apart is its hands-on approach, exemplified by the KPMG Consulting Capstone Experience.
