Program Details
The B.Sc. in Economics and Finance program at UPES is designed to offer students the opportunity to master economic theory and financial principles. The coursework focuses on project-based learning where economics and financial models are explained using real-world data and case studies. The economics and finance core courses are designed to build a strong theoretical foundation in the subjects, along with analytical tools and quantitative skills. A team of dedicated faculty leads the program from the best institutions in the world and provides individual guidance to students to excel in the program.
Transdisciplinary Learning
What sets our program apart is its emphasis on transdisciplinary learning, where students are encouraged to draw connections between economics and finance and explore the interactions between these disciplines. For example, students are thoroughly trained to apply economic theories to analyze the behaviour of financial markets and to use econometrics models for financial forecasting. Similarly, students exploring courses on artificial intelligence may use their programming skills to develop cutting-edge algorithms for financial analysis.
Experiential Pedagogy
The program curriculum has a strong focus on student learning beyond traditional lectures. Case studies and simulations are one of the primary pedagogy tools where students are presented with real-world financial problems faced by listed companies and organizations, allowing them to apply theoretical concepts to practical situations. The curriculum focuses on project-based assessment of students. Through individual projects, students analyze financial data, make decisions, and present their findings in the form of a report. The projects allow students to apply their learning in a practical context and develop analytical and problem-solving skills. We have a Data Lab equipped with state-of-the-art statistical software and financial applications. Students use their time outside the classroom to develop the expertise to use these applications for their projects. In addition, the program encourages students to attend national and international conferences and workshops where they can learn about the latest developments in the fields of economics and finance. Additional emphasis is given in developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills so that students are successful in a wide range of professional positions.
Global Exposure
The B.Sc. program provides students with unparalleled global exposure and opportunities for cross-cultural learning. Students have the chance to broaden their outlook and enhance their undergraduate experience through our semester exchange and semester abroad programs at prestigious institutions such as the University of Bologna in Italy, the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, the University of Warsaw in Poland, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in South Korea, HEIP: School of International and Political Studies in France, or University of California, Berkeley.
Faculty from Renowned Institutions
The B.Sc. program is led by a team of distinguished faculty from leading universities in India and abroad. Their diverse academic background and research interests complement the hands-on experiential learning focus of the program. Their dedication towards excellence in teaching and research ensures that our students receive the best training towards their degrees. The faculty provides individual guidance and mentorship to each student and prepares them to have a successful career in professional positions.

Program Details
The B.Sc. in Economics and Finance program at UPES is designed to offer students the opportunity to master economic theory and financial principles. The coursework focuses on project-based learning where economics and financial models are explained using real-world data and case studies. The economics and finance core courses are designed to build a strong theoretical foundation in the subjects, along with analytical tools and quantitative skills. A team of dedicated faculty leads the program from the best institutions in the world and provides individual guidance to students to excel in the program.
Transdisciplinary Learning
What sets our program apart is its emphasis on transdisciplinary learning, where students are encouraged to draw connections between economics and finance and explore the interactions between these disciplines. For example, students are thoroughly trained to apply economic theories to analyze the behaviour of financial markets and to use econometrics models for financial forecasting. Similarly, students exploring courses on artificial intelligence may use their programming skills to develop cutting-edge algorithms for financial analysis.
Experiential Pedagogy
The program curriculum has a strong focus on student learning beyond traditional lectures. Case studies and simulations are one of the primary pedagogy tools where students are presented with real-world financial problems faced by listed companies and organizations, allowing them to apply theoretical concepts to practical situations. The curriculum focuses on project-based assessment of students. Through individual projects, students analyze financial data, make decisions, and present their findings in the form of a report. The projects allow students to apply their learning in a practical context and develop analytical and problem-solving skills. We have a Data Lab equipped with state-of-the-art statistical software and financial applications. Students use their time outside the classroom to develop the expertise to use these applications for their projects. In addition, the program encourages students to attend national and international conferences and workshops where they can learn about the latest developments in the fields of economics and finance. Additional emphasis is given in developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills so that students are successful in a wide range of professional positions.
Global Exposure
The B.Sc. program provides students with unparalleled global exposure and opportunities for cross-cultural learning. Students have the chance to broaden their outlook and enhance their undergraduate experience through our semester exchange and semester abroad programs at prestigious institutions such as the University of Bologna in Italy, the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, the University of Warsaw in Poland, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in South Korea, HEIP: School of International and Political Studies in France, or University of California, Berkeley.
Faculty from Renowned Institutions
The B.Sc. program is led by a team of distinguished faculty from leading universities in India and abroad. Their diverse academic background and research interests complement the hands-on experiential learning focus of the program. Their dedication towards excellence in teaching and research ensures that our students receive the best training towards their degrees.

What sets our program apart is its emphasis on transdisciplinary learning, where students are encouraged to draw connections between economics and finance and explore the interactions between these disciplines. For example, students are thoroughly trained to apply economic theories to analyze the behaviour of financial markets and to use econometrics models for financial forecasting. Similarly, students exploring courses on artificial intelligence may use their programming skills to develop cutting-edge algorithms for financial analysis.
Experiential Pedagogy
The program curriculum has a strong focus on student learning beyond traditional lectures. Case studies and simulations are one of the primary pedagogy tools where students are presented with real-world financial problems faced by listed companies and organizations, allowing them to apply theoretical concepts to practical situations. The curriculum focuses on project-based assessment of students. Through individual projects, students analyze financial data, make decisions, and present their findings in the form of a report. The projects allow students to apply their learning in a practical context and develop analytical and problem-solving skills. We have a Data Lab equipped with state-of-the-art statistical software and financial applications. Students use their time outside the classroom to develop the expertise to use these applications for their projects. In addition, the program encourages students to attend national and international conferences and workshops where they can learn about the latest developments in the fields of economics and finance. Additional emphasis is given in developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills so that students are successful in a wide range of professional positions.
Global Exposure
The B.Sc. program provides students with unparalleled global exposure and opportunities for cross-cultural learning. Students have the chance to broaden their outlook and enhance their undergraduate experience through our semester exchange and semester abroad programs at prestigious institutions such as the University of Bologna in Italy, the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, the University of Warsaw in Poland, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in South Korea, HEIP: School of International and Political Studies in France, or University of California, Berkeley.
Faculty from Renowned Institutions
The B.Sc. program is led by a team of distinguished faculty from leading universities in India and abroad. Their diverse academic background and research interests complement the hands-on experiential learning focus of the program. Their dedication towards excellence in teaching and research ensures that our students receive the best training towards their degrees. The faculty provides individual guidance and mentorship to each student and prepares them to have a successful career in professional positions.
