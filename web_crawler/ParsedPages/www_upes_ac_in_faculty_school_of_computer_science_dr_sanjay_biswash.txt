Prof. (Dr.) Sanjay Biswash

Professor

Profile Summary
Prof. (Dr.) Sanjay Biswash is a university professor, cutting-edge researcher, academic mentor, and supervisor to students. He completed his Ph.D in Computer Science and Engineering in 2012  from IIT(ISM),  Dhanbad. Thereafter he actively enjoyed teaching, learning, research, and innovations.  He supervised/mentored 120+ of Ph.D./ M.Tech./ MS/ B.Tech./ B.S. students for their academic degree.  His thrust research areas are "Mobile, Networks, and Pervasive" network systems. He served as editor and editorial board of many reputed journals i.e. Mobile Networks and Applications, Wireless Personal Communication, etc. He also has experience conducting workshops in IEEE ANTS for four consecutive years. He published more than 75 research papers in premium publications in refereed journals and top tier Conferences, and reputed book publisher. He also holds a Patent for his research contribution, and reviewer of many top-class international Publishers such as IEEE, ACM, Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, IET, etc. He is an active member of the 6G Task Force USA.  He accomplished many international projects funded by, the European Union, NSF (USA), CNPq (Brazil), Russian Federation, etc.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Prof. Biswash holds multiple national and international positions around the globe, i.e,
Associate Professor CSE, NIIT University, Neemrana,  Rajasthan, India.
Associate Professor and  HoD in CSE, VPKBIET Baramati, Pune, India.
Research Scientist, National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Tomsk, Russia.
Research Associate, National Laboratory of Scientific Computing (LNCC), Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Post-Doctoral Researcher  San Diego State University, San Diego, California, USA.
Post-Doctoral Researcher, University of Coimbra, Portugal.
Assistant Professor in  CSE,  Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, UP, India.
Research Scholar in Department of CSE, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India.
Research Interests
Fog and Edge Networks (seamless integration with 6G networks).
6G Networks (5G and Beyond communication system).
Secure and trustworthy communication networks.
Networks Security and Cybersecurity.
Next-generation cellular networks (5GB network, 5G networks, Device-to-Device, Energy-efficient network, Green networks).
QoS and QoE in Wireless mobile networks.
Network management (Mobility management and Location management).
Nature-inspired networks (Ant's pattern, Bee fly pattern, Artificial immune system).
Teaching Philosophy
Prof. Biswash teaching philosophy is focus  on teaching and learning has been changed with time. I started my teaching carrier as a faculty in 2011 at MNNIT Allahabad, with the belief of high-quality lectures delivery, and motivate the students towards revision, textbook study and self-learning. Thus, my focus was on teaching and craft the best possible lectures series. Slightly, I realize that being a good teacher is much more than being a good lecturer. In fact, the focus on lectures is true in some context; but i was missing the complete point of study and learning. Now, my focus on study, education, problem-solving skill, research and discovery, self study, analytical skills, and learning for a better mankind.

Prof. (Dr.) Sanjay Biswash is a university professor, cutting-edge researcher, academic mentor, and supervisor to students. He completed his Ph.D in Computer Science and Engineering in 2012  from IIT(ISM),  Dhanbad. Thereafter he actively enjoyed teaching, learning, research, and innovations.  He supervised/mentored 120+ of Ph.D./ M.Tech./ MS/ B.Tech./ B.S. students for their academic degree.  His thrust research areas are "Mobile, Networks, and Pervasive" network systems. He served as editor and editorial board of many reputed journals i.e. Mobile Networks and Applications, Wireless Personal Communication, etc. He also has experience conducting workshops in IEEE ANTS for four consecutive years. He published more than 75 research papers in premium publications in refereed journals and top tier Conferences, and reputed book publisher. He also holds a Patent for his research contribution, and reviewer of many top-class international Publishers such as IEEE, ACM, Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, IET, etc. He is an active member of the 6G Task Force USA.  He accomplished many international projects funded by, the European Union, NSF (USA), CNPq (Brazil), Russian Federation, etc.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Prof. Biswash holds multiple national and international positions around the globe, i.e,
Associate Professor CSE, NIIT University, Neemrana,  Rajasthan, India.
Associate Professor and  HoD in CSE, VPKBIET Baramati, Pune, India.
Research Scientist, National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, Tomsk, Russia.
Research Associate, National Laboratory of Scientific Computing (LNCC), Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Post-Doctoral Researcher  San Diego State University, San Diego, California, USA.
Post-Doctoral Researcher, University of Coimbra, Portugal.
Assistant Professor in  CSE,  Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, UP, India.
Research Scholar in Department of CSE, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India.
Research Interests
Fog and Edge Networks (seamless integration with 6G networks).
6G Networks (5G and Beyond communication system).
Secure and trustworthy communication networks.
Networks Security and Cybersecurity.
Next-generation cellular networks (5GB network, 5G networks, Device-to-Device, Energy-efficient network, Green networks).
QoS and QoE in Wireless mobile networks.
Network management (Mobility management and Location management).
Nature-inspired networks (Ant's pattern, Bee fly pattern, Artificial immune system).
Teaching Philosophy
Prof. Biswash teaching philosophy is focus  on teaching and learning has been changed with time. I started my teaching carrier as a faculty in 2011 at MNNIT Allahabad, with the belief of high-quality lectures delivery, and motivate the students towards revision, textbook study and self-learning. Thus, my focus was on teaching and craft the best possible lectures series. Slightly, I realize that being a good teacher is much more than being a good lecturer. In fact, the focus on lectures is true in some context; but i was missing the complete point of study and learning. Now, my focus on study, education, problem-solving skill, research and discovery, self study, analytical skills, and learning for a better mankind.

Teaching Philosophy
Prof. Biswash teaching philosophy is focus  on teaching and learning has been changed with time. I started my teaching carrier as a faculty in 2011 at MNNIT Allahabad, with the belief of high-quality lectures delivery, and motivate the students towards revision, textbook study and self-learning. Thus, my focus was on teaching and craft the best possible lectures series. Slightly, I realize that being a good teacher is much more than being a good lecturer. In fact, the focus on lectures is true in some context; but i was missing the complete point of study and learning. Now, my focus on study, education, problem-solving skill, research and discovery, self study, analytical skills, and learning for a better mankind.
