Confluence of creativity, culture and technology
UPES School of Design fosters a vibrant ecosystem where students and faculty explore the intersection of artistic expression, cultural heritage, and cutting-edge technology. It emphasises the role of design in documenting and safeguarding cultural heritage for future generations, using technology as a medium for preservation and storytelling.
