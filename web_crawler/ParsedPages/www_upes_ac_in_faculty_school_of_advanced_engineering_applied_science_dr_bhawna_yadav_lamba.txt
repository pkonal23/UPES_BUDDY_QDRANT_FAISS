Dr. Bhawna Yadav Lamba

Professor

Profile Summary
Professor Bhawna is an Organic Chemist specializing in Polymer Technology and Organic Chemistry. Her research primarily focuses on two important areas: Waste Management and Biofuels. She has conducted extensive research on the preparation, characterization, and oxidation stability of biofuels and their blends with high-speed diesel, contributing significantly to the field of biofuels. In waste management, her primary focus is on adding value to various waste streams, including municipal mixed waste plastics, medical waste (such as PPE kits), and wastewater.
Work Experience
Dr. Bhawna joined UPES in July 2004 and has since fulfilled significant academic and non-academic responsibilities. In addition, she also convened Summer School, coordinated Project Abhilasha, designed and taught a course on "Engineering and Polymer Material for Professionals" at Finolex, served as a consultant for Nissan Technology and Maruti, actively participated in CSR activities, and served as the head of the Department of Chemistry.
Research Interests
Her specialization lies in biofuels and waste management, with a specific focus on enhancing the oxidation stability of biofuels for commercialization. In waste management, she works on converting municipal mixed waste plastic and medical waste (such as PPE kits) into plasto oil, an alternative to diesel fuel. Driven by her passion for sustainable solutions, she has successfully completed five externally funded research projects. Currently, she is involved in a DST_ITDD sponsored project on microalgae-mediated wastewater reclamation, aiming for bio-oil and biogas production, with a sanctioned amount of INR 73,01,360/-. Her research contributes significantly to the fields of biofuels and waste management.
Teaching Philosophy
Professor Bhawna believes in cultivating an environment that fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and active learning. She connects science to real-world applications, encouraging students to explore practical implications and contribute meaningfully. Her teaching methods involve students conducting research, presenting their findings, and working with actual data to nurture problem-solving skills.
Courses Taught
Prof. Bhawna teaches Chemistry courses, including Organic Chemistry and Polymer-related subjects, to both undergraduate and graduate students. These courses equip students with essential knowledge, practical skills, and a thorough understanding of the applications and implications of these disciplines, enabling them to pursue diverse careers and address societal challenges. She also teaches B.Tech students Engineering Chemistry, with a primary focus on applying Chemistry to their respective fields.
Awards and Grants
Prof. Bhawna has received several prestigious awards and recognition for her outstanding contributions. She was honoured with the IGEN Women Achiever Award-2021 in Energy Efficiency for her green community engagement. The SRM Institute of Science & Technology acknowledged her as an Inspiring Educator. She also received the UPES Long Service Award & Dedicated Service Award. Additionally, she wrote one of the 15 most-read articles on biofuels, with coverage by over 80 news outlets. Her research projects, totalling five externally funded projects, have significantly contributed to sustainable solutions in biofuels and waste management.
Scholarly Activities
Apart from her research contributions, Prof. Bhawna has worked as a consultant for Nissan Technology and Maruti Udyog on the storage behaviour of refined fuel. She has supervised doctoral candidates and continues to do so. Furthermore, she has designed and taught courses on Engineering and Polymer Materials for working professionals at Finolex. Her completed research projects include the value addition of wastepaper to woodless pencils, installation and commissioning of a Biodiesel plant, enhancement of oxidation stability of Biodiesel and diesel blends, and wastewater treatment with bio-oil, biogas, and biomanure production using zero waste technology.
