Her doctoral thesis engaged with the complexities of veiling practices in twentieth century Indian English Writing. She is currently working on the emergence and evolution of stand-up comedy in India. Her edited volumes,
Punching Up in Stand-Up Comedy: Speaking Truth to Power
(Routledge, 2022) and
Politics of Recognition and Representation in Indian Stand-Up Comedy
(Palgrave Macmillan, forthcoming) engage with the aesthetics and politics of comedy.
While teaching in University of Delhi, she organised various seminars and conferences such as National Students’ Seminar titled, “What Do You Meme?”, Inter-College Student Paper Presentation Webinar titled, “Politics of Humour” (2020), Student Monthly seminar titled “Speculations about the Spectacular: Reading Fantasy Films” (2018), Inter-College Student Seminar titled, “Literature’s Engagement with Technology”, as part of Ekphrasis, the annual literary fest of the Department of English.
