5 tips to build confidence and self-esteem
Abhishek Verma
Published 15/05/2020
Believing in yourself and reaching out for your goals with gratitude in your heart can work miracles
The biggest tragedies of our professional and personal lives happen when we stop believing in ourselves. Whether it is low self-esteem, self-limiting beliefs, lack of self-reliance, or fear of doing something out of our comfort zone, the result is often seriously damaging.
Sometimes it is an echo of previous mistakes, and sometimes it is a fear of present or upcoming challenges.
If you feel demotivated to take charge of your life and actions, you are either living to someone else’s expectations, or you simply do not believe in your potential.
The ultimate fact and truth is that we have been trained and conditioned all through our lives to doubt ourselves. We have an inherent fear of losing. We must reorient ourselves to remove our fears and self-doubt in order to build self-worth and confidence.
Remember, whatever you attain in life is a result of your belief in yourself.
Here are the five most essential stages to learning how to believe in yourself. Imbibe them and you will be astonished at the results:
1. Treat yourself well
You need to understand the importance of self-love. Recognize your worth and never brush aside the power of embracing yourself for the good deeds that you have done and forgive yourself for all the misfortunes you encountered. There is always a ray of hope to shine again. There is a sunshine after every storm. Feel valued, feel loved, believe that you are a rock star! Love yourself unconditionally.
2. Believe in the power of affirmations
When you believe in yourself, you first have to believe that what you aspire or want is really within your reach. Believe in positive self-talk; convert all the negatives into positives, refrain from using the words – I cannot, it is impossible, I am worthless, nobody loves me, I am a loser, etc. Rescript it, start using I can, I will, it is possible, I am capable, I am doing it now, I am a winner. In fact, the mind is such a powerful instrument, it can deliver literally everything you want through the power of positive affirmations.
Ronald Alexander, a noted leadership consultant, writes in his bestseller  ‘Wise Mind, Open Mind’” that in order to be successful you really need to get rid of negative self-talk and judgements.
3. Believe in your uniqueness. Yes, you are different!
Embrace yourself as you are, not as you ought to be, or as someone else wants you should be. You are different. Unleash your uniqueness. You will find one. We all have our own abilities, skills, and flairs that make us extraordinary. We usually do not have a fair idea of our competencies. The most challenging thing to do in life is to accept how different and unique we really can be.
4. Practice gratitude and be action oriented
Nurture the attitude of gratitude, feel thankful for the good things you have as it makes you contended and elated from inside. It makes you feel positive and only a positive mind can result in positive actions. Take charge of your life. You have the potential to surpass any storm.
5. Be persistent
Accomplishment is always about persistence, fortitude and the power of self-belief. Hindrances and denials are a part of any great endeavor, so we must feel optimistic and constantly remind ourselves that after every night there is a dawn. Rejections and setbacks help us explore, nurture, and evolve as a better version of ourselves. It develops a winning mindset through which we can conquer all our problems and surge ahead on the path to everlasting happiness.

You need to understand the importance of self-love. Recognize your worth and never brush aside the power of embracing yourself for the good deeds that you have done and forgive yourself for all the misfortunes you encountered. There is always a ray of hope to shine again. There is a sunshine after every storm. Feel valued, feel loved, believe that you are a rock star! Love yourself unconditionally.
2. Believe in the power of affirmations
When you believe in yourself, you first have to believe that what you aspire or want is really within your reach. Believe in positive self-talk; convert all the negatives into positives, refrain from using the words – I cannot, it is impossible, I am worthless, nobody loves me, I am a loser, etc. Rescript it, start using I can, I will, it is possible, I am capable, I am doing it now, I am a winner. In fact, the mind is such a powerful instrument, it can deliver literally everything you want through the power of positive affirmations.
Ronald Alexander, a noted leadership consultant, writes in his bestseller  ‘Wise Mind, Open Mind’” that in order to be successful you really need to get rid of negative self-talk and judgements.
3. Believe in your uniqueness. Yes, you are different!
Embrace yourself as you are, not as you ought to be, or as someone else wants you should be. You are different. Unleash your uniqueness. You will find one. We all have our own abilities, skills, and flairs that make us extraordinary. We usually do not have a fair idea of our competencies. The most challenging thing to do in life is to accept how different and unique we really can be.
4. Practice gratitude and be action oriented
Nurture the attitude of gratitude, feel thankful for the good things you have as it makes you contended and elated from inside. It makes you feel positive and only a positive mind can result in positive actions. Take charge of your life. You have the potential to surpass any storm.
5. Be persistent
Accomplishment is always about persistence, fortitude and the power of self-belief. Hindrances and denials are a part of any great endeavor, so we must feel optimistic and constantly remind ourselves that after every night there is a dawn. Rejections and setbacks help us explore, nurture, and evolve as a better version of ourselves. It develops a winning mindset through which we can conquer all our problems and surge ahead on the path to everlasting happiness.

5 tips to build confidence and self-esteem

Published 15/05/2020

















Believing in yourself and reaching out for your goals with gratitude in your heart can work miracles
The biggest tragedies of our professional and personal lives happen when we stop believing in ourselves. Whether it is low self-esteem, self-limiting beliefs, lack of self-reliance, or fear of doing something out of our comfort zone, the result is often seriously damaging.
Sometimes it is an echo of previous mistakes, and sometimes it is a fear of present or upcoming challenges.
If you feel demotivated to take charge of your life and actions, you are either living to someone else’s expectations, or you simply do not believe in your potential.
The ultimate fact and truth is that we have been trained and conditioned all through our lives to doubt ourselves. We have an inherent fear of losing. We must reorient ourselves to remove our fears and self-doubt in order to build self-worth and confidence.
Remember, whatever you attain in life is a result of your belief in yourself.
Here are the five most essential stages to learning how to believe in yourself. Imbibe them and you will be astonished at the results:
1. Treat yourself well
You need to understand the importance of self-love. Recognize your worth and never brush aside the power of embracing yourself for the good deeds that you have done and forgive yourself for all the misfortunes you encountered. There is always a ray of hope to shine again. There is a sunshine after every storm. Feel valued, feel loved, believe that you are a rock star! Love yourself unconditionally.
