Explore popular career options with a geochemistry degree
Dr. Sunil Kumar Khare
Published 04/05/2021
Geochemistry is divided into areas such as organic geochemistry, inorganic geochemistry and environmental geochemistry, among several others
Geochemistry is a fascinating field that studies chemistry of earth and combines the principles of two disciplines—chemistry and geology. Geochemists use their expertise to study atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere and analyse natural resources like minerals, groundwater, oil and gas. They study composition of these resources and decode the information contained in them. Research done by geochemists is used by experts in different fields, which includes oil, mineral and water exploration, environmental studies, global warming studies, earthquake studies, water quality studies and cleaning up of toxic waste sites.
Those studying geochemistry have an opportunity to pursue a career in emerging area of human concern such as climate change and global warming studies, earth ocean and atmospheric science studies and environmental consultancies. They have lucrative career opportunities as geochemist / geologist / scientist in mineral and mining companies, oil and gas companies and research institutes and as faculty in universities and centres of higher learning. Depending on which career path a qualified geochemist chooses, work duties could range from planning scientific studies, field visits, lab analytical studies, publication of research findings in high impact journals and contributing to environmental management policies etc. among others.
To become a geochemist in India, you are required to pursue science stream at the 10+2 level. A bachelor’s degree in a relevant discipline such as Chemistry, Physics and Geology, followed by a Master’s degree in a discipline like Petroleum Geosciences of UPES with specialization in Environmental Geochemistry is required.
Geochemistry is divided into areas such as organic geochemistry, inorganic geochemistry and environmental geochemistry, among several others. Environmental geochemistry, a relatively new field, is the discipline that explores the sources, distribution and interactions of chemical elements in air, soil, rocks, water and biological material.
Over the course of last decade, the field of environmental geochemistry has grown manifold. Graduates in this discipline are in demand for work such as environmental consulting, interpretation of chemical behaviour, and analysing scientific data for a commercial or research laboratory.
UPES offers the M.Sc. Petroleum Geoscience program with specialization in Environmental Geochemistry, which prepares students for a promising career as geochemist. The two-year program has been developed to cater to the demand for high-level skills in this field.
If you are fascinated by the Earth and its natural resources, you must consider a career in geochemistry. It not only offers a chance to work with experts and professionals from different fields but also gives you an opportunity to solve the planet’s many hidden problems and mysteries.

Geochemists use their expertise to study atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere and analyse natural resources like minerals, groundwater, oil and gas. They study composition of these resources and decode the information contained in them. Research done by geochemists is used by experts in different fields, which includes oil, mineral and water exploration, environmental studies, global warming studies, earthquake studies, water quality studies and cleaning up of toxic waste sites.
Those studying geochemistry have an opportunity to pursue a career in emerging area of human concern such as climate change and global warming studies, earth ocean and atmospheric science studies and environmental consultancies. They have lucrative career opportunities as geochemist / geologist / scientist in mineral and mining companies, oil and gas companies and research institutes and as faculty in universities and centres of higher learning. Depending on which career path a qualified geochemist chooses, work duties could range from planning scientific studies, field visits, lab analytical studies, publication of research findings in high impact journals and contributing to environmental management policies etc. among others.
To become a geochemist in India, you are required to pursue science stream at the 10+2 level. A bachelor’s degree in a relevant discipline such as Chemistry, Physics and Geology, followed by a Master’s degree in a discipline like Petroleum Geosciences of UPES with specialization in Environmental Geochemistry is required.
Geochemistry is divided into areas such as organic geochemistry, inorganic geochemistry and environmental geochemistry, among several others. Environmental geochemistry, a relatively new field, is the discipline that explores the sources, distribution and interactions of chemical elements in air, soil, rocks, water and biological material.
Over the course of last decade, the field of environmental geochemistry has grown manifold. Graduates in this discipline are in demand for work such as environmental consulting, interpretation of chemical behaviour, and analysing scientific data for a commercial or research laboratory.
UPES offers the M.Sc. Petroleum Geoscience program with specialization in Environmental Geochemistry, which prepares students for a promising career as geochemist. The two-year program has been developed to cater to the demand for high-level skills in this field.
If you are fascinated by the Earth and its natural resources, you must consider a career in geochemistry. It not only offers a chance to work with experts and professionals from different fields but also gives you an opportunity to solve the planet’s many hidden problems and mysteries.
