Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. It addresses the need for universal energy access, promoting renewable sources, and improving energy efficiency to combat climate change and foster inclusive development.

Goals under the SDG are:
Ensure widespread access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.
Increase the proportion of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
Promote international collaboration to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology.
Expand infrastructure for providing modern and sustainable energy services in developing countries, with a focus on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries.

Major Activities conducted/ policies implemented by UPES:
The Centre for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability Studies (CEESS)
, a premier research center at UPES School of Business, specializes in multidisciplinary research encompassing Economics, Environment, Energy, Globalization, Trade, Transport, Supply Chain, and Sustainable Development. Aligned with India's environmental policies, CEESS conducts informed research and development to propose policy reforms, supporting the nation's goals of self-dependence, employment generation, and enhanced value addition in both manufacturing and services sectors. Research areas include Energy Business, Sustainable Development, Environmental Economics, Climate Change, Transportation, Globalization, Marketing Management, and Public Policy. CEESS functions as a hub for promoting research, international collaborations, joint-funded proposals, interdisciplinary studies, and knowledge dissemination through workshops, seminars, conferences, and publications. The center actively builds networks with industry, research think tanks, and ministries, fostering collaborative research efforts at national and international levels.
The University offers the following programmes-
MBA Power Management - Green Energy and Transition To Sustainability
M.Tech. Renewable Energy
BBA Green Energy And Sustainability - Green Energy Business
Post Graduate Program (PGP) in Renewable Energy-Online
B.Tech. in Clean Energy Technologies
UPES Mechanical Engineering students, designed and built
U-BAHN, an electric vehicle for on-campus use
. The prototype, created with guidance from faculty, features an 85AH battery, a brushless DC motor, and IoT technology for location tracking. Costing only Rs. 2 lakh, U-BAHN is an economical and eco-friendly alternative to traditional golf carts, showcasing UPES students' commitment to sustainable innovation.
Researchers at UPES developed a
self-powering Solar Tree
set up at UPES campus. In addition to the solar tree, they also developed a
model bicycle with an electric motor
that is an eco-friendly step towards short-distance transportation. The integrated electric motor can be used for propulsion of the bicycle to a speed of 30-35 kilometers per hour without pedaling for up to a run of 70-80 kilometers.
UPES has installed
solar power plant of capacity 100 kW
. In the last five years, 8% demand of the total power consumption has been catered by the solar power plant. The solar plant is also being utilised for the training and project purposes for the students.
The School of Engineering's Sustainability Cluster at UPES organized the
'Sustainability Fair 2022,'
scheduled from October 11 to 14, themed 'Safe, Resilient, and Sustainable Cities & Communities.' Governor Lt General Gurmit Singh inaugurated the event, commending UPES's educational contributions. Dr. Sunil Rai emphasized the fair's goal of showcasing research on sustainability, fostering cost-effective solutions, and facilitating industry-academia collaboration. The four-day summit includes training sessions, model competitions, exhibitions, panel discussions, and international symposiums, drawing participants from various sectors and countries. Funding and support come from partners like Punjab National Bank and DST-SERB.
