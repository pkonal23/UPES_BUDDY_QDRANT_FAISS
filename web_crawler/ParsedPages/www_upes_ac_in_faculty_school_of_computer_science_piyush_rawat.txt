Piyush Rawat

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Piyush Rawat completed his Ph.D. from NIT Hamirpur in 2022. He received his MTech (Computer Science and Technology) from NIT Hamirpur in 2018. Piyush Rawat has his research experience in the field of Wireless Sensor Networks. He has authored research articles published in SCI/Scopus/ESCI-indexed journals.
Work Experience
Piyush Rawat is currently with UPES, since June 2022, as an Assistant Professor.
Research Interests
Wireless Sensor Networks I IoT
Teaching Philosophy
Teaching is a highly stimulating experience for Dr. Rawat, and he is deeply passionate about it. He firmly believes that teaching is a mutual learning process, especially within a research environment where the boundaries of knowledge are explored. In his view, teaching involves articulating and elucidating concepts to learners, which serves as a compelling incentive for the teacher to have a clear understanding of those concepts. Through teaching, he develops appropriate abstractions of concepts to facilitate meaningful learning, and this process greatly enhances his own comprehension of the subject matter. These abstractions ultimately contribute to a better grasp of the body of knowledge, thereby supporting its expansion through research endeavours.
Courses Taught
Data Communication and Computer Networks | Digital Logic
Awards and Grants
He qualified Graduate Aptitude Test (GATE) conducted in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019.
Scholarly Activities
He has published/presented many research papers at international conferences and in international journals.
