Suchita Pande

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Suchita Pande is an accomplished researcher and educator with a robust background in biomedical engineering, biotechnology, and molecular cardiology. She holds a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology from the University of Massachusetts Lowell and has made significant contributions to understanding cardiovascular diseases and protein function. Her postdoctoral work at Tufts Medical Center focused on MLK3 overexpression and its therapeutic potential for cardiac remodeling. Pande has published extensively in top-tier journals and received numerous honors, including the Natalie V. Zucker Research Center for Women Scholars Award.
Work Experience
Prior to joining UPES, Dr. Pande was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Molecular Cardiology Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, USA. Over there, she led a study to evaluate how AAV9-mediated mediated MLK3 overexpression affects the left ventricular hypertrophy in mice with TAC-induced pressure overload. Her earlier research at the University of Massachusetts Lowell focused on structural and functional analysis of proteins, with a focus on ERAP1 and GA enzymes. She identified key residues in the hydrophobic pocket of ERAP1 that significantly affect the recognition and binding of precursor antigenic peptides, crucial for immunogenic response. Using recombinant protein production and X-ray crystallography techniques she also investigated structural alterations in GA enzyme caused by point mutations that leads to a rare disease called aspartylglucosaminuria.
Research Interests
Dr. Pande’s research interests include the development of therapeutics for cardiovascular and other metabolic diseases, protein function, and the structural analysis of proteins involved in disease pathways. She integrates molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural techniques to investigate therapeutic targets for cardiac remodeling and immune function.
Teaching Philosophy
Pande believes in fostering critical thinking and hands-on learning in the classroom. Her approach emphasizes interactive, practical application of scientific concepts, encouraging students to develop problem-solving skills through laboratory work and real-world scenarios. She is dedicated to mentoring and guiding students to excel in research and scientific inquiry.
Courses Taught
At UPES, Pande teaches courses related to biotechnology, molecular biology and genetics. She also directed laboratory sessions at the University of Massachusetts Lowell focusing on life sciences, experimental biology, recombinant protein production and X-ray crystallography.
Awards and Grants
Pande has received several prestigious awards, including the Natalie V. Zucker Research Center for Women Scholars Award Grant (2020).
Scholarly Activities
Pande has published multiple research papers in renowned journals, including Immunology, Circ Heart Fail, Protein Science, and FEBS Lett. Her work focuses on proteins such as MLK3, ERAP1 and GA, with significant contributions to understanding cardiac function, immune response and rare diseases. She has presented her research at conferences such as the Basic Cardiovascular Sciences Scientific Sessions and Molecular Cardiology Research Institute retreats. Additionally, she serves as a reviewer for BMC Cardiovascular Disorders.
