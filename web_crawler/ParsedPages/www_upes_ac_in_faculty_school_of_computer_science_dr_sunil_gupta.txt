Dr. Sunil Gupta

Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Sunil Gupta is an alumnus of the prestigious NIT Jalandhar and NIT Hamirpur.  He is an academic with a broad variety of research, development, industrial, and administrative expertise. Dr. Gupta has worked in both higher education and industry for more than a decade.  He has played a key role in developing innovative curricula in cutting-edge technological fields at UPES and BMU as a professor. Dr. Gupta has always felt that education should extend beyond the classroom; therefore, have worked hard to instil ideals and provide students with a solid moral basis. Dr. Gupta has worked on formulating academic policies, innovating teaching-learning pedagogies, engaging students, educating about new technologies, consulting, conducting research, attending conferences, publishing journals, building connections with the business world, etc.
Work Experience
Dr. Sunil Gupta has more than 19 years of expertise in the fields of computer science and engineering in teaching, research, and industry. He held positions with BML Munjal University, Delhi Technical Campus, IP University, Northern India Engineering College, IIMT, Baddi University of Emerging Science, IFTM University, and Physical Laboratory before becoming a professor at UPES. He is a life member of the International Association of Engineers, the IEEE Society, the Computer Society of India, the Computer Science Teacher Association, the International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology, and the Internet Society (ISOC).
Research Interests
Focus on secure connection between two entities to provide authentication and remove attacks. Authentication for cloud security, Wireless sensor security, Tele-medical healthcare, Data Management and Security, Security in grid and resources, Information, IP & Web security, Resource Management in Wireless Networks, Service Discovery, Resource Management, Network Protocols and Architecture, Network Management.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr Gupta has always found it rewarding to watch students put theory into practice.  He believes in creating a space in the classroom where students may learn independently and express their creativity. This kind of instruction is partially carried out through discussions of various opportunities during lectures and questions. The utilisation of examples from everyday life also serves as a source of motivation, and connecting classroom discussions with either current affairs or my professional experience also helps to demonstrate to the students the value and significance of the subjects being taught. As a result, a large portion of his efforts in the courses, are focused on creating practical experiences, assignments, projects, and presentation opportunities that are closely tied to the lectures.

Teaching Philosophy
Dr Gupta has always found it rewarding to watch students put theory into practice.
