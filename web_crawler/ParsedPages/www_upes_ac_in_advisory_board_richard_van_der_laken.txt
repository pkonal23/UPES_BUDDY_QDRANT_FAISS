Richard Van Der Laken

Co-founder & Director, What Design Can Do

Richard Van der Laken is a creative director based in Amsterdam. He met Pepijn Zurburg while studying at the Utrecht School of Art and Sandburg institute, and together they formed De Designpolitie - a renowned visual design agency, a graphic design collective Gorilla, and What Design Can Do (WDCD). Since forming, they’ve worked with many partners from Rabobank to Artis Zoo, won numerous awards, and featured in the permanent collection of galleries such as the Design Museum London and MoMa New York. At WDCD, they’ve created multiple design challenges, publications, and events hosted across Amsterdam, Brazil and Mexico. If Richard’s not in the office, he’s probably halfway across the world (virtually as well these days), preaching the What Design Can Do story at conferences like TED, The Next Web or Design Indaba.
