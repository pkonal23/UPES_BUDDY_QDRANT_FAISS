Siddhi Deshpande, Bhasha Maheshwari, Shruti Bamb - Achievement

Siddhi Deshpande, Bhasha Maheshwari, and Shruti Maheshwari, students of B.Des. with specialisation in Industrial Product Design were honoured with a Special Mention Award in Product Design at the MIT-WPU National Design Award 2022 for their innovative menstrual hygiene product, Vendo.
The brainchild of three creative design students, Siddhi Deshpande, Bhasha Maheshwari, and Shruti Maheshwari, is their product Vendo. This remarkable creation addresses hygiene management in public restrooms with a sustainable, accessible, and eco-friendly approach. Vendo is ingeniously designed as a fusion of a sanitary napkin vending machine and an incinerator. This unique combination facilitates the easy disposal of used napkins through the incinerator, while the vending section ensures round-the-clock availability of sanitary napkins. The machine operates with a nominal token fee of INR 5, offering three distinct pad size options.
