Major Activities conducted/ policies implemented by UPES:
Dr. Bhawna Lamba developed the
wastewater reclamation plant
.
Supported by a ₹73 lakh project, it employs microalgae to treat sewage water, yielding zero waste.
The first-of-its-kind in India, the site boasts a lab, pond, CSTR, and Hydrothermal Liquefaction Reactor, reflecting a collaborative effort between UPES and Vikalp Nai Dishayen.
Dr. Bhawna's inspiration from the Swachh Bharat campaign and her expertise in Polymer Technology underpin this groundbreaking venture, currently at Technology Readiness Level 7.
As per Central Ground Water Authorities, UPES is a
‘Zero Water Discharge’ campus
.
The University recycled 250 KL of water in the horticulture section, has a 550 KLPD (Kilo Litre Per Day) of recycling capacity, and all rainwater harvesting pits have water flow metres to ensure the feeding of rainwater to the ground, leading to 89% savings of water.
Project Swachhata
focuses on contributing to ‘Clean India’ mission through sustained cleaning of the adjoining community areas
