UPES School of Law, in collaboration with the Uttarakhand Forest Department and Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board, hosted the International Conference on New Paradigms in Environmental Sustainability and Energy Laws from September 20-21, 2024. The conference featured insightful discussions on pressing environmental issues such as climate change, renewable energy, and environmental governance. It aimed to provide a platform for legal experts, policymakers, academics, and students to explore innovative legal frameworks and sustainable practices that align with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Distinguished legal professionals, environmental advocates, and academicians from various national and international institutions participated, including representatives from 66 Indian institutes and 6 foreign organizations. The conference served as an important venue for sharing research, promoting collaboration, and addressing complex legal and ethical concerns related to environmental sustainability. The diverse participants contributed through research presentations and panel discussions, facilitating a broad exchange of ideas. Sessions also provided participants with valuable insights on how technological advancements can be leveraged to solve complex environmental problems, while also addressing the legal and ethical concerns associated with these innovations.
The conference featured dynamic panel discussions and interactive sessions on topics including environmental governance, renewable energy laws, climate justice, and legal compliance in a rapidly evolving world and brought together several environmental experts including bureaucrats, academicians, advocate on record, social activists and practising advocates from top law firms. Dr. Dhananjai Mohan, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF), Shri. Umesh Dwivedi, Member of Legislative Council, Former President at Divine Disaster Management Inquiry Committee, Uttar Pradesh Mr. Anoop Nautiyal (Founder of Social Develop for Communities (SDC) Foundation), Ms. Pragya Parijat Singh (Advocate-on-record, Supreme Court of India, Member Executive SCAORA, Founder of Pranutan Legal), Dr. Ankur Kansal (Environment Engineer, Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board), and Mr. Aman Rab (Legal Advisor to DGP, Pollution Board, Municipal Corporation, SEIAA, RERA and Special Counsel for Govt. of Uttarakhand) were among the many others who graced the conference with their presence.
