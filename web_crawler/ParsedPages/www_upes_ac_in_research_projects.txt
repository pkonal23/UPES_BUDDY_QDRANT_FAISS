It seeks to transform subsistence farming into a profitable agribusiness while preserving the unique Himalayan ecosystem. By reducing dependency on synthetic fertilizers and the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis, the initiative promotes environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Additionally, the project focuses on establishing high-quality seed banks for potato and fodder crops, ensuring improved soil health and crop sustainability for long-term benefits.
Key Highlights:
Nano Pyrite Priming:
Sustainable, cost-effective method replacing fertilizers to boost plant growth.
Improved Productivity:

Application and Impact:
The proposed strategy significantly reduces the cost of cultivation, with nano pyrite priming costing only INR 26 per hectare compared to INR 890 for traditional fertilizers. This one-time treatment minimises labor and increases crop resilience in harsh climates and challenging terrains. Potato and fodder crops treated with nano pyrite develop a denser root network, improving soil retention and crop sturdiness. The project addresses critical challenges in the Himalayan region, including below-average potato productivity and a 49.9% deficit in fodder. By enhancing crop yields and promoting sustainable practices, the project supports food security, improves milk production through better fodder availability, and reduces environmental impact, ultimately empowering small-scale farmers in mountainous terrains.

Title:
Development of Impact Resistive and Thermally Resilient Hybrid Laminated Composite Panel for Personal and Vehicle Armours

Funding Agency:
Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)

Objectives:

The project aims to overcome the limitations of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers in ballistic protection systems, such as low creep resistance, low melting temperature, and poor bonding with polymer matrices. The project enhances the thermal and mechanical properties of UHMWPE fibers and polyurethane resin by using surface-modified graphene oxide and a patented electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. These treated fibers will be integrated into hybrid laminated composite panels, tested for energy absorption under high-velocity impacts, and analysed for damage mechanisms.

Morphotectonic assessment of structurally induced geohazard potential areas within the MBT Zone: NW of Dehradun, Uttarakhand
Funding Agency:
Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
Objective:
The project aims to map tectonically induced landforms and analyse the geohazard potential along the MBT zone in the central Himalayan region of Uttarakhand. It leverages advanced techniques such as InSAR/GLA/ML/SPIM modeling and field-based methods to identify zones of active deformation. Additionally, the project seeks to generate hazard maps and delineate active landform morphology, contributing to the establishment of a chronology of paleoseismic events. These efforts are directed towards supporting sustainable urban planning and development in the region.
Key Highlights:
Conduct fault linkage analysis of the Sirmauri Tal Fault (STF) and Malgi Fault (MF) and their connectivity with the MBT for hazard potential and landform evolution.
Map geological and geomorphic evidence of active deformation and create 3D stereographic projections to assess stress build-up and landslide vulnerability zones.
Analyse ground deformation patterns using InSAR/PSINSAR and SPIM modeling techniques.
Perform susceptibility assessments and categorisation of landslides in the study area.
Application and Impact:
The project will enhance understanding of the Quaternary evolutionary history and hazard potential of the MBT zones, focusing on neotectonic and seismic events that shaped the region's terrain. It will deliver precise geohazard and active fault maps for densely populated areas between Dehradun and eastern Himachal Pradesh. These findings will support urban development, town planning, and civil engineering efforts, ensuring safer and more sustainable infrastructure in the region.
