How Moot Court Competitions help students to become successful lawyers
Preeti Aneja
Published 12/03/2021
Moot Court Competitions are a popular platform for budding law professionals to understand the fine nuances of mooting. The process helps law students develop a deep understanding of the policies and procedures followed in a court
A moot court accomplishment on your resume helps your prospective recruiter to know that you have been learning to form and communicate legal arguments, implying that the firm would not have to invest a lot of time and resources in training you.
“Mooting plays an important role in the career of law students. It is the closest experience a law student can get to appear before a court-like set-up. The activity requires ancillary skills such as formulation of arguments, respecting the judges, and preparation of written memorials/submissions that are not a part of public speaking and debating. The significance of
mooting can be underlined by the benefits it offers
such as a chance to network with fellow students and judges and confidence building,” says
Dr. Anju Pandey, Convener, Moot Court Association (MCA), UPES, School of Law.
MCA promotes all aspects of mooting and trial advocacy in the
School of Law, UPES, Dehradun.
The body comprises handpicked students who are exceptional mooters and committed to the cause of nurturing their fellow mates. The association conducts multiple events like seminars, workshops, and competitions for law students across the globe. Every year, it organizes five Moot Courts namely
Internal Moot Court Competition, Novice Moot Court Competition, Surana & Surana Insolvency Moot Court Competition
, Trial Advocacy and Paras Diwan Energy Law Moot Court Competition. All these mooting events have earned a high reputation in the law fraternity and witness large participation from reputed law schools.

Samriddh Bindal, a UPES alumnus and an advocate by profession
, highlights what students stand to learn by participating in Moot Courts. He says, “Since my first year, Moot Court Competitions have been a part of my routine in law school. Not only participating, but I would also spend time organising moot events or helping my friends prepare for their moot competitions. Mooting has not only taught me the way to study law, meet my research objectives, and develop my argumentative skills but it has altogether moulded me into a better person. It also helped me understand the significance of teamwork, patience, and the ability to work under pressure.”
Elucidating on the insights she gained from mooting,
Kirandeep Kaur, student, BBA LLB (Corporate Laws) and winner of a Moot Court Competition
, says, “Team-work, hard work and perseverance are key elements; any lack there would impact your chances to win. From making memorial and compendium to preparing for the oral sessions while balancing your emotions would help to complete your work on time with minimal error.”
Throwing light on how mooting prepares law students for life, Shubh Agarwal, UPES alumnus from the batch of BA LLB Taxation, 2015-2020, currently working as an Associate at SKS Associates, Litigators and Consultants, says, “Moot Court trains a student to find the relevant law and develop abstract thinking. It gives the much desired practical exposure, ranging from drafting to representation. It also instils a spirit of teamwork and healthy competition, so students are not only prepared for a successful legal career but for life,” he concludes.

, highlights what students stand to learn by participating in Moot Courts. He says, “Since my first year, Moot Court Competitions have been a part of my routine in law school. Not only participating, but I would also spend time organising moot events or helping my friends prepare for their moot competitions. Mooting has not only taught me the way to study law, meet my research objectives, and develop my argumentative skills but it has altogether moulded me into a better person. It also helped me understand the significance of teamwork, patience, and the ability to work under pressure.”
Elucidating on the insights she gained from mooting,
Kirandeep Kaur, student, BBA LLB (Corporate Laws) and winner of a Moot Court Competition
, says, “Team-work, hard work and perseverance are key elements; any lack there would impact your chances to win. From making memorial and compendium to preparing for the oral sessions while balancing your emotions would help to complete your work on time with minimal error.”
Throwing light on how mooting prepares law students for life, Shubh Agarwal, UPES alumnus from the batch of BA LLB Taxation, 2015-2020, currently working as an Associate at SKS Associates, Litigators and Consultants, says, “Moot Court trains a student to find the relevant law and develop abstract thinking. It gives the much desired practical exposure, ranging from drafting to representation. It also instils a spirit of teamwork and healthy competition, so students are not only prepared for a successful legal career but for life,” he concludes.

How Moot Court Competitions help students to become successful lawyers

Published 12/03/2021

















Moot Court Competitions are a popular platform for budding law professionals to understand the fine nuances of mooting. The process helps law students develop a deep understanding of the policies and procedures followed in a court
A moot court accomplishment on your resume helps your prospective recruiter to know that you have been learning to form and communicate legal arguments, implying that the firm would not have to invest a lot of time and resources in training you.
“Mooting plays an important role in the career of law students. It is the closest experience a law student can get to appear before a court-like set-up. The activity requires ancillary skills such as formulation of arguments, respecting the judges, and preparation of written memorials/submissions that are not a part of public speaking and debating. The significance of
mooting can be underlined by the benefits it offers
such as a chance to network with fellow students and judges and confidence building,” says
Dr. Anju Pandey, Convener, Moot Court Association (MCA), UPES, School of Law.
