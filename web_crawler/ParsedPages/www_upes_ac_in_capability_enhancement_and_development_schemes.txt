Employability Boot camps
The vision of the Employability Boot camp (EB) is to launch studentsâ€™ careers with work readiness workshops to improve employability prospects. Collaboration with the industry experts and alumni offers students access to real-world job recruitment processes, helps them understand the corporate scenario and manages their aspirations and job expectations. Students are empowered through workshops on resume building, writing job applications and cover letters and skills to clear the recruitment process. It prepares them to understand and accept constructive feedback on where to improve and how to forge their path in their careers.
Employability Boot Camps help students build confidence and make a seamless transition from the campus to the corporate world.
Students are able to identify their core strengths and communicate to employers the ways to unlock their true potential.
They rediscover that their passion for their domain will impact the world.
Students connect with alumni to clear their doubts and dilemmas about the upcoming placement season.
Career Counselling
EDGE community page on UPES Learning Management System acts as a social tool for scheduling appointments for seeking personal career coaching and counselling. The goal of this approach is to develop new means of reaching out to and supporting the student community for a higher level of career adaptability in students and enhancing their employability skills.
Soft Skill development through PEP & PSI
Personality Enhancement Program (PEP)
is a flagship event of the Department of Humanities. It is organized in collaboration with Dale Carnegie. The three-day event is aimed at facilitating the transition for undergraduate and post-graduate students at two levels â€“ transition from school to college and transition from college to industry. The experiential-based learning is focused on three skills, i.e., behavioural skills, people skills and presentation skills. These skills are honed via a series of engaging activities where a trainer is assigned to the batch in the capacity of a facilitator and a coach.
Placement Selection Improvement (PSI)
programÂ intends to groom students for better placement opportunities and enhance their employability prospects. Its goals are to:
Inculcate confidence in students through practical learning
Make them experience real interview situations
Make them industry-ready professionals
Make them aware of their shortcomings in PI by sharing real-time feedback
PSI helps students to understand and analyze their actual value in the market. They get an opportunity to be exposed to various situations that require immediate attention. It enables them to prepare in the areas which otherwise impede their chances of better placements. Subject matter experts help them to uncover the gap in the current level of technical competencies from the expected ones.

Personal Counseling
- We at UPES have a well-developed team of professionals offering empathetic hands to lift students out of the pit of ambiguities, disappointments, confusion, and depression. Our full-time psychological counsellor adopts a holistic approach and factors in all aspects of a studentâ€™s life while providing group and one-to-one counselling. Difficulties in academics and learning are dealt with through faculty mentors. UPES is among one of the few universities that understand the student's need for a friend, guide, role model and mentor. The department of Student Engagement and Experience works closely with students to ensure a wide range of initiatives and activities for engaging them throughout the academic year.
List of students attended counselling sessions
Remedial Coaching
- Considering the importance of supporting the students to overcome their learning difficulties and gain confidence and interest in learning, remedial classes are planned and organized each year.
The remedial classes are therefore conducted for the students whose performance is not up to the mark, i.e., for the students who secure less than 40% marks in the Mid-Term Examination.
These classes help the weak students to fill the gaps in the teaching-learning process which may be due to their slow learning pace, lack of understanding, lack of motivation, etc. and ultimately enhance their learning and skills, resulting in improvement in their performance.
