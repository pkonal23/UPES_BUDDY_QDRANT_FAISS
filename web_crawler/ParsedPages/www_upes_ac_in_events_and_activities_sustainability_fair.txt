About
The legacy of the Sustainability Fair series, starting with the inaugural 2022 event graced by the Governor of Uttarakhand, Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Gurmit Singh has firmly established it as a beacon of sustainability innovation. Sustainability Fair 1.0 focused on "Safe, Resilient, and Sustainable Cities & Communities," bringing together over 1,000 participants, including international scientists from Spain, Denmark, and Sri Lanka, alongside national leaders such as the Cabinet Minister of Uttarakhand. Prominent stakeholders such as Punjab National Bank, DST-SERB, and Springer as well as American Chemical Society (ACS) supported the event. Sustainability Fair 2.0 raised the bar even higher, engaging more than 1,200 delegates, showcasing 283 research presentations, and featuring over 50 organisational participants, with keynote addresses by global leaders like Padma Bhushan Dr Anil Joshi. These successes, driven by impactful collaborations and groundbreaking discussions, demand an even more remarkable third edition.
Building on the overwhelming response to HSFEA 2016, HSFEA 2018, HSFEA 2020, and HSFEA 2023, the Sustainability Cluster, UPES School of Advanced Engineering, is organising the 5th International Sustainability Conference on Health, Safety, Fire, and Environmental Advances (HSFEA-2025) during 9-10 April 2025. under the umbrella of Sustainability Fair 3.0 The theme of HSFEA 2025 is “Innovating for a Resilient Future.” Health, Safety, Fire, and Environmental Advances aim to foster a multidisciplinary platform for researchers, professionals, policymakers, and industry experts to share insights, exchange knowledge, and explore advancements in promoting global well-being. With a focus on the interplay between health, safety, fire management, environmental sustainability, and related disciplines, this conference seeks to uncover innovative approaches, emerging technologies, and collaborative strategies to address the challenges faced by communities worldwide.
Expectations from Sustainability Fair 3.0
Sustainability Fair 3.0 is set to surpass its predecessors by fostering a larger global network. With anticipated participation from over 1,500 delegates, including policymakers, industry leaders, and international researchers, the event aims to drive innovation and collaboration across various sustainability domains. Featuring keynote addresses from renowned sustainability pioneers and support from returning sponsors such as Adani, Reliance, and Springer, it promises an unparalleled exchange of knowledge. The fair will also host groundbreaking panel discussions, exhibits, and workshops, alongside the presentation of 300+ research papers and expanded partnerships with Q1 journals. This event is poised to redefine sustainability benchmarks, further enhancing UPES’s stature as a global hub for sustainability.
Sustainability Cluster, School of Advanced Engineering
The Sustainability Cluster is a union of two former School of Advanced Engineering departments, namely Civil Engineering and Health, Safety & Environment Engineering. It offers NBA-accredited undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programmes and comprises a professionally qualified faculty team with national and international experience in academia and industry. The Cluster boasts state-of-the-art infrastructure, including advanced laboratories, a fire training ground, cutting-edge software, and other facilities. Students actively participate in live and sponsored projects funded by the government and consultancy assignments. It hosts international and national student chapters such as the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Safety Professionals (ASSP), the Fire & Security Association of India (FSAI), and the GreenUp Club. Additionally, it prepares students for certifications in professional courses such as NEBOSH, IOSH, and Lead Auditor (9001, 14001, 45001, 17025) and Swayam NPTEL courses.
