The Rise of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Their Impact on the Automotive Industry
UPES Editorial Team
Published 26/09/2024
EV Sales in India have seen a rise of a massive 42%! The rise of electric cars (EVs) is causing a revolution in the automotive sector. EVs, which were formerly a niche market, are now leading the way in transportation and spurring innovation.
Exciting times are ahead for you if you are interested in Automotive Engineering. In this blog, we'll explore the rise of EVs, their impact on the automotive industry, and why pursuing a B.Tech in
Automotive Engineering
is a smart choice.
Why EVs: Shift from Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) to Electric Vehicles
Since time immemorial, ICEs have powered vehicles worldwide. However, with growing concerns over climate change and carbon emissions, it's only wise that the automotive industry transition to electric mobility.
Electric vehicles offer several advantages over traditional ICE vehicles. They produce zero tailpipe emissions, making them more eco-friendly and playing a key role in reducing global carbon footprints. EVs are also more efficient, with fewer moving parts, leading to lower maintenance costs for consumers.
Technological advancements have further accelerated the rise of EVs. Improved battery storage, faster-charging infrastructure, and innovations by automakers like Tesla, GM, and Ford have made EVs more accessible and practical for everyday users.
The Impact
of EVs on the Automotive Industry
Redefining Vehicle Design and Manufacturing
EVs run on electric motors, batteries, and electronics as opposed to traditional cars, which depend on intricate ICEs and mechanical parts. As a result, the emphasis is now more on aerodynamic designs and lightweight materials to increase vehicle range and energy efficiency. To construct electric vehicles, the industry currently mostly uses sophisticated electronics and software because fewer mechanical parts are needed. Automotive engineers must adjust to these new technologies to develop, construct, and maintain electric vehicles (EVs).
Disruption in Automotive Jobs and Skills
New opportunities for engineers specializing in electric powertrains, battery technology, and vehicle electronics are upcoming now, as the EV revolution has reduced the demand for traditional ICE-related jobs.
Companies are actively seeking professionals skilled in these areas, as the industry evolves to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles.
This is an exciting time to be an aspiring engineer. The creation, production, and upkeep of electric vehicles present bright futures with lots of room for advancement. In the upcoming years, there will be an increasing need for professionals with knowledge in electric vehicle design, testing, and sustainability.
Opportunities in Automotive Engineering with the EV Revolution

The Rise of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Their Impact on the Automotive Industry
UPES Editorial Team
Published 26/09/2024
EV Sales in India have seen a rise of a massive 42%! The rise of electric cars (EVs) is causing a revolution in the automotive sector. EVs, which were formerly a niche market, are now leading the way in transportation and spurring innovation.
Exciting times are ahead for you if you are interested in Automotive Engineering. In this blog, we'll explore the rise of EVs, their impact on the automotive industry, and why pursuing a B.Tech in
Automotive Engineering
is a smart choice.
Why EVs: Shift from Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) to Electric Vehicles
Since time immemorial, ICEs have powered vehicles worldwide. However, with growing concerns over climate change and carbon emissions, it's only wise that the automotive industry transition to electric mobility.
Electric vehicles offer several advantages over traditional ICE vehicles. They produce zero tailpipe emissions, making them more eco-friendly and playing a key role in reducing global carbon footprints. EVs are also more efficient, with fewer moving parts, leading to lower maintenance costs for consumers.
Technological advancements have further accelerated the rise of EVs. Improved battery storage, faster-charging infrastructure, and innovations by automakers like Tesla, GM, and Ford have made EVs more accessible and practical for everyday users.
The Impact
of EVs on the Automotive Industry
Redefining Vehicle Design and Manufacturing
EVs run on electric motors, batteries, and electronics as opposed to traditional cars, which depend on intricate ICEs and mechanical parts. As a result, the emphasis is now more on aerodynamic designs and lightweight materials to increase vehicle range and energy efficiency. To construct electric vehicles, the industry currently mostly uses sophisticated electronics and software because fewer mechanical parts are needed. Automotive engineers must adjust to these new technologies to develop, construct, and maintain electric vehicles (EVs).
Disruption in Automotive Jobs and Skills
New opportunities for engineers specializing in electric powertrains, battery technology, and vehicle electronics are upcoming now, as the EV revolution has reduced the demand for traditional ICE-related jobs.
Companies are actively seeking professionals skilled in these areas, as the industry evolves to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles.
This is an exciting time to be an aspiring engineer. The creation, production, and upkeep of electric vehicles present bright futures with lots of room for advancement. In the upcoming years, there will be an increasing need for professionals with knowledge in electric vehicle design, testing, and sustainability.
