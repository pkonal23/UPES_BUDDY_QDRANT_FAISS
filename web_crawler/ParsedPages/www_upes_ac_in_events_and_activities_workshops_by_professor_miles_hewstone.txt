Event Idea and Objective
The primary goal of the workshops was to equip participants with the skills needed to develop research ideas, write impactful research articles, and navigate the academic publishing process.
The first day, titled "How to Be a Researcher? Developing Ideas for Research and Publishing Your Findings," covered key topics such as crafting hypotheses, structuring research, and managing peer reviews. Prof. Hewstone highlighted the importance of clear communication, proper punctuation, and avoiding jargon.
On the second day, "Research Writing Unplugged: Lessons from a Pro (and His Slip-Ups!)," Prof. Hewstone delved into common mistakes made by researchers and offered practical advice on overcoming them. Participants also explored themes of open science, triangulation, and the inevitable challenges of rejection.
Both workshops were open to faculty from other universities and were streamed online for global participation.
In addition to the workshops, Prof. Hewstone delivered lectures on key topics in social psychology, covering the history and seminal experiments in the field. He explored reasons behind conformity, the impact of social norms on decision-making, and the psychological factors driving aggression and altruism. The lectures examined both the positive and negative effects of social group dynamics, providing students with deeper insights into the forces shaping our social world.
