Moot Court Committee (School of Law):
Moot Court means a replica of a real court where legal proceedings and trials take place and thus it is also known as a Mock Court. Where students who are studying law act as professionals and take up all the responsibilities and duties according to their role to see their ability to think creatively and answer convincingly when questioned and show their oratory, writing and persuasive skills. It is one of the modern methods of giving practical knowledge to the students by putting them in a hypothetical situation similar to that of a real court and then the two teams each on one side argue upon fictional cases.
