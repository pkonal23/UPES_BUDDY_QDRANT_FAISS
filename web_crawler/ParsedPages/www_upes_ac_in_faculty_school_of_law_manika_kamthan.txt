Assistant Professor -Selection Grade

Profile Summary
Dr. Manika Kamthan is a lawyer by training. She holds Ph.D. on “Women in Agriculture: A Comparative Study of Selected Villages in U.P. and Punjab” from CSLG/JNU. She also holds graduate and post graduate degrees in law from A.M.U. She also did her M.Phil from the Centre for the Study of Law & Governance (CSLG), JNU.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Dr. Manika was at the Symbiosis Law School, Pune. She has also worked with School of Law, Northcap University, Gurugram and Amity Law School, Noida. She also worked as a Research Assistant in the “University Project of Excellence” on “Climate Change in Western Ghats” in JNU.
Research Interests
Gender & law, disaster and social vulnerabilities, politics of identity, constitutional law and environment studies.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Manika’s teaching philosophy reflects my interests in collaborative authorship. Instead of the "full frontal teaching" method of large lectures of autocratic seminars, she prefers student-centric teaching that encourages learning by both students and teachers. She favours classroom dynamics that permit dialogue and foster a degree of student input as to curricula and grading criteria. Dr. Manika encourages students to spend a fair amount of time in smaller groups in which they not only talk and think together but write together. She emphasizes critical thinking and the need to consider law within its larger social, historical, and intellectual contexts.
Courses Taught
Gender Justice and Feminist Jurisprudence Prevention of Sexual Harassment Law Legal Research Writing
Research Methods and Legal Writing
Comparative Human Rights of Women and Children Constitutional Law
Labour Law
Protection and Enforcement of Human Rights Migration and EU Legal Issues
Law of Sustainable Development
