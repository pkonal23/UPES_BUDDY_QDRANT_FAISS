Industry In The Classroom
UPES has been bringing professionals from various industries into the classroom to share their insights, experiences, and knowledge with students. This approach aims to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application, providing students with a deeper understanding of how concepts are applied in real business or industry contexts.

At the UPES School of Law, one of the important elements is to focus on clinical legal education, which emphasises the practical skills of research, court craft, advocacy, counselling, negotiations, and legal drafting. Understanding the market practices and the commercial aspects of transactions differentiates a regular lawyer from a sought-after one.

The Bar Council of India and the UGC recognise the importance of involving practising advocates and professionals in the teaching and learning process of law schools. To this end, UPES School of Law has a policy on the appointment of Professors of Practice (PoPs), which essentially is an engagement of senior practising advocates and eminent legal professionals. This aligns with international best practices followed by several top foreign universities and law schools.

The capacity-building initiative
Anusandhan
keeps faculty and students updated with the latest developments around the globe, while the dedicated IPR cell focuses on technology transfer opportunities through patents and copyrights. UPES's commitment to cutting-edge research is evident through collaborations with prestigious organisations such as CERN in Switzerland and KEK in Japan, enabling partnership in the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and Belle II projects.
UPES is probably the fastest growing university in India in terms of research output, with current publications output being about 4 papers per faculty per year with average citations of the recently published papers similar to top institutions globally such as MIT, NUS, Oxford and Cambridge University, and surpass those of leading Indian research institutions such as IISc Bangalore, IITs, etc. In 2024 (

UPES academic community includes leading scholars and researchers, such as a Nobel Prize nominee and recipients of prestigious scholarships like Rhodes, Fulbright, Chevening, Commonwealth, Erasmus, Eiffel and DAAD, These scholars have been trained at some of the best institutions in the world, including Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, the University of California Berkeley, Oxford, Cambridge, National University of Singapore, Indian Institute of Science, IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) and so on. Notably 46 UPES faculty members have been featured among the world's top 2% of researchers in their respective fields, according to a research study published by a Stanford University-based research group.
UPES supports over 660 PhD scholars and ₹13 Crore allocated annually for fellowships and research.
