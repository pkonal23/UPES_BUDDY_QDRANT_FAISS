About the Department
Knowledge of the fundamental principles of any discipline is key to obtaining an overall and in-depth understanding of the subject. The Department of Applied Sciences aims to fulfill this exact need. By fostering the fundamental principles and understanding of science, these courses aim to enhance the students’ overall learning experience.
The Department was established to equip engineering students with fundamental concepts of Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics.
In the year 2018, the department started its own UG programs, B.Sc. (H) in Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry and subsequently started PG programs in 2019. The Ph.D. program was also started in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics to produce high-quality researchers in several areas of Fundamental and Applied Sciences.
The department boasts of a team of highly-acclaimed researchers and faculty members who have expertise in the fields of material science, nanotechnology, applied optics, modeling and simulation, biofuels, composite materials, polymers, photo-catalysis, organic synthesis, solar cells, water treatment, optimisation, fluid mechanics, image processing, numerical analysis, differential geometry, etc. Many of them have been recognised by various academic bodies within and outside India, and have also received prestigious awards and fellowships.
The department also prides itself on being sought out for research and consultancy projects.
It has carried out and completed a large number of research and consultancy projects funded by national (DST, BPCL, IOCL, DST-SERB) and international (ABB) organisations.
For an  industry-ready learning experience, the department has access to several state-of-the-art student labs and research-grade instruments for performing high-end research. Global collaboration partners from Germany, Japan, Slovenia, Switzerland, the US, etc. in several research areas of mutual interest allow students to gain a broader, global perspective.
