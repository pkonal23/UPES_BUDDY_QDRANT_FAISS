About
The workshop "From Trigger to Teaching Note" aimed to equip participants with the essential skills needed to create compelling case studies. It focused on several key areas, including how to select impactful cases, structure them effectively, and utilize decision dilemmas as powerful teaching tools. Participants learned practical techniques for transforming their case ideas into clear, actionable objectives, enhancing their interview skills, and understanding best practices in case writing and publication.
Emphasizing interactive learning, the workshop combined theoretical insights with hands-on activities. Participants engaged in role plays, stepping into the shoes of both case protagonists and writers, which helped them develop their interviewing and storytelling abilities. This experiential approach allowed them to gain a deeper understanding of the case study development process, identify and avoid common writing pitfalls, manage data efficiently, and adhere to established publication guidelines.
The event also fostered a collaborative learning environment where participants could share experiences and insights. Real-world examples were used to illustrate effective case structuring and teaching methods, providing attendees with a comprehensive view of what makes a case study successful. By the end of the workshop, participants felt more confident in their ability to write and publish high-quality case studies that effectively engage and educate their audiences.
This workshop not only enhanced individual skills but also encouraged networking and collaboration among participants, creating a community of future case writers and educators.
