Therefore, he attempts to incorporate experiential learning into his classes, compelling students to think analytically and critically. His classrooms are open spaces where questioning is encouraged. He also incorporates the Socratic Method and modern ICT tools to keep his classes interesting and to further his philosophy of establishing a classroom that aids in the real-world application of theoretical tools.

He has also been invited to deliver lectures on the Constitution and Intellectual Property Laws, among other topics, by institutions in Karnataka and Kerala.
Scholarly Activities
Abhijit has various publications in areas pertaining to Free Speech, Gender and Sexual Expression within the Constitutional framework, Media and Privacy Laws, Constitutional aspects of Environmental Laws, and Affirmative Action. He continues to explore emerging areas of law and life, such as technology, with a focus on their interaction with Constitutional Law principles.
