She made contributions to the business- social-technical ecosystems through the formal positions in organizations like SAP and IBM and informal engagements with industry groups like NASSCOM Deep Tech Club, Lumis Supply Chain Club, "Industrial Internet Consortium for Industry 4.0" and "Digital Twin Consortium".
Technology, for Bharti, is more than just a profession – it's a passion. She believes that because technology is embedded into everything around us, it presents us with immense possibilities to open new frontiers, create amazing experiences, explore horizons of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and make this world a more sustainable place. She helps customers leverage the power of Design-thinking, Digital Core, Deep-tech and innovation to turn into an intelligent enterprise.
