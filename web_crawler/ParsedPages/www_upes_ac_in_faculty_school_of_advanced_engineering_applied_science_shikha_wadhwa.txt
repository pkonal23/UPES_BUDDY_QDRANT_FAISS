Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Wadhwa firmly believes in creating a supportive and encouraging environment to facilitate student learning. She actively inspires students through various teaching methods such as the 'Flipped Classroom' method of teaching. It is an educational approach in which the traditional roles of in-class instruction and homework are reversed or "flipped." In this model, students are exposed to instructional content, such as lectures or readings, outside of the classroom, typically through digital resources like videos or online materials. Class time is then dedicated to interactive activities, discussions, problem-solving, and other engaging exercises that allow students to apply and deepen their understanding of the material. The aim of the flipped classroom is to enhance active learning, encourage critical thinking, and provide more personalized interactions between teachers and students during face-to-face sessions.
Courses Taught
Dr. Wadhwa imparts her expertise in chemistry courses, particularly Organic Chemistry with a focus on Spectroscopic Techniques, Physical Chemistry involving Crystal Structure, Solutions, and Gases, and Analytical Chemistry involving Separation & Electroanalytical Techniques. She has also taught Nanotechnology and Chemistry-related subjects such as Chemistry for Nanomaterials, Industrial Applications of Nano-sized Materials, Nanostructured Surfaces for Photocatalytic Applications, Introduction to materials, Interfacial Nanochemistry, Properties of nanomaterials, and Scientific Data Analysis Techniques in Nanotechnology.
Awards and Grants
Throughout her academic journey, Dr. Wadhwa has been recognized for her exceptional achievements. She achieved 3rd rank in MSc at the University and received the Vice Chancellorsâ€™ Research Scholarship to pursue her PhD degree in 2007. She was honoured with the 'Industry Expert' award by the Amity Institute of Nanotechnology, Amity University Noida, in 2014. Dr. Wadhwa also received the DST-UKIERI award from the Department of Science & Technology in 2017 to work on "Facilitating the Intelligent Management of Chronic Wounds in Diabetic Patients". Currently, she is actively involved in the UGC-DAE CSR collaborative project titled "Investigation of the interaction of hydrogen with Pd-Ag and Pd-GO alloy thin films for hydrogen sensing and storage applications".
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Wadhwa is currently leading a collaborative UGC-DAE CSR project, investigating the properties of palladium-based composites for hydrogen sensing and storage applications. She has been a part of the prestigious DST-UKIERI Project, a collaborative project between India and the UK, and has collaborated with esteemed institutions worldwide. She is also actively guiding 3 Ph.D. scholars and has a remarkable record of attending 30 National and International conferences in India and abroad. She has delivered around 15 invited talks and her prolific research contributions include 52 research articles with a total impact factor of 235, h-index of 17, i10-index of 26, over 900 citations, 9 book chapters, and 2 complete Indian patents.
