Profile Summary
Siddhartha Mukherjee is a seasoned Professional Architect and Industrial Designer who currently serves as a Design Educator at the School of Design, UPES. With a wealth of experience spanning nearly a decade, he has adeptly navigated various roles, including Architect, Product Designer, and Design Researcher and Educator. Siddhartha's educational journey includes a bachelor's in architecture from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, followed by a Post Graduation in Industrial Design from the prestigious Industrial Design Centre at IIT Bombay.
Work Experience
Siddhartha Mukherjee commenced his career as an intern Architect at Interface Designers in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, gaining significant exposure to Residential, Institutional, and Hospitality projects while pursuing his Bachelor's in Architecture. He later pursued a Master's in Product Design from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay, where he explored the fusion of Art, Design, and Society. An internship at Visva Bharati University in Sri Niketan, West Bengal, enabled him to delve into material processes like Batik and Block printing on traditional leather products.
Following his Post-Graduation, Siddhartha joined Godrej and Boyce Mfg. Co. Ltd., contributing to innovative Security Devices including Safes, Lockers, and Electronic Home Security Solutions. Notably, he was selected for the prestigious HORIZON programme in collaboration with the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, focusing on evolving paradigms in the Security Product Industry.
Relocating to Dehradun in 2017, Siddhartha engaged in Research-Driven Architectural Design projects and briefly taught at DIT University before joining UPES in 2018.
Research Interests
Furniture Design, Sustainable Cooking Appliances, Cultural Studies, Traditional Interiors, Art Design and Society
Teaching Philosophy
Siddhartha's teaching philosophy centres on the fusion of Serendipity, Synergy, and Symbiosis in Design education. As students evolve into designers, the Teacher-Student Relationship transforms from Facilitator to Guide to Peer. Design, Siddhartha believes, is a collective generational knowledge rooted in individual experiences, enriched by cultural problem-solving and storytelling.
Siddhartha's teaching approach mirrors professional practice. He advocates for bridging theory and real-world scenarios, equipping students with adaptable skills. This philosophy aims to cultivate culturally rooted designers who excel as dynamic problem solvers in the global design arena.
