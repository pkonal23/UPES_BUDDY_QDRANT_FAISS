Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Kaushik Ghosh is a reflective practitioner. He believes pedagogical skills are to be honed in an iterative manner. According to him, an educator must be receptive enough to understand the needs of the new-age learners, as the teaching-learning process has undergone a paradigm shift in the post-pandemic era. A teacher has to be a learner, before anything else. He believes that constructive feedback received from students and fellow professionals is a great way to attain effective pedagogical skills.
