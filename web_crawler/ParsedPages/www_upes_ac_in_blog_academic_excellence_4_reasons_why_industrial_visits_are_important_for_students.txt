4 reasons why industrial visits are important for students
Pankhuri Bhardwaj
Published 03/07/2020
UPES industrial visits are one of their kind – enriching experiences focussed on networking and learning practical lessons about work processes and business functions
Industrial visits are a great learning platform for students. They bridge the gap between classroom learning and practical working conditions. At UPES, there is a lot of emphasis on holistic learning. Industrial visits are, therefore, a crucial part of the university’s curriculum as they provide a practical perspective of the workplace environment to students.
I truly cherish my three-day industrial visit to Mumbai, which took place in January 2020 as part of my
BBA General Management program
. The trip was with my 52 classmates and our faculty members Ms. Preeti Aneja, Dr. Nitesh Adichwal and Dr. Deepak Bangwal to the city of dreams.
To help us understand the significance of industry-academia connection, our mentors ensured that we gave our 100% attention and effort in absorbing all the knowledge being shared with us.
Here are the four reasons why this trip was an enriching experience:
Bonds forever
From Dehradun to landing at the Mumbai airport, the endless chitchat, grabbing seats together in buses and planes to taking selfies at every location, made for happy memories and helped us foster bonds for life.
The bus games and late-night conversations with the faculty were such a delight. It made us see a new side of our faculty members – complete fun and equally caring at the same time. I also realised that there is a hidden talent in each one of us.
The industrial visits were truly about learning beyond the books
Industrial exposure
We visited two companies, Godrej & Boyce and Fork Media.
The industrial visits were truly about learning beyond the books. We visited the production units, interacted with managers, team leaders and supervisors. We listened to their experiences, their journey and the hard work they had put in to reach this pinnacle of success.
Fun unlimited
We started with the central mall of Navi Mumbai where we all could shop, play, eat, and relax. We visited almost all the popular places in the city within our reach like the Gateway of India, Juhu Beach and Marine Drive. We thoroughly enjoyed the boat rides, the street food and the sunsets.
We thoroughly enjoyed the boat rides, the street food and the sunset
Employability enhancement
During our interaction with the HR managers and CEO of the companies, we expressed our willingness to intern and work with them.
The mentors of the industries liked our batch and offered us
assistance for future internships and placements
. They connected with us via their social media handles like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook. The industrial visits proved to be a great platform for networking.
I am grateful for this opportunity that helped me see the world in a different and realistic manner. Thanks to my alma mater, UPES, for planning it so well and adding value to my BBA journey.

4 reasons why industrial visits are important for students

UPES industrial visits are one of their kind – enriching experiences focussed on networking and learning practical lessons about work processes and business functions
Industrial visits are a great learning platform for students. They bridge the gap between classroom learning and practical working conditions. At UPES, there is a lot of emphasis on holistic learning. Industrial visits are, therefore, a crucial part of the university’s curriculum as they provide a practical perspective of the workplace environment to students.
I truly cherish my three-day industrial visit to Mumbai, which took place in January 2020 as part of my
BBA General Management program
. The trip was with my 52 classmates and our faculty members Ms. Preeti Aneja, Dr. Nitesh Adichwal and Dr. Deepak Bangwal to the city of dreams.
To help us understand the significance of industry-academia connection, our mentors ensured that we gave our 100% attention and effort in absorbing all the knowledge being shared with us.
Here are the four reasons why this trip was an enriching experience:
Bonds forever
From Dehradun to landing at the Mumbai airport, the endless chitchat, grabbing seats together in buses and planes to taking selfies at every location, made for happy memories and helped us foster bonds for life.
The bus games and late-night conversations with the faculty were such a delight. It made us see a new side of our faculty members – complete fun and equally caring at the same time. I also realised that there is a hidden talent in each one of us.
The industrial visits were truly about learning beyond the books
Industrial exposure
We visited two companies, Godrej & Boyce and Fork Media.
The industrial visits were truly about learning beyond the books. We visited the production units, interacted with managers, team leaders and supervisors. We listened to their experiences, their journey and the hard work they had put in to reach this pinnacle of success.
Fun unlimited
We started with the central mall of Navi Mumbai where we all could shop, play, eat, and relax. We visited almost all the popular places in the city within our reach like the Gateway of India, Juhu Beach and Marine Drive. We thoroughly enjoyed the boat rides, the street food and the sunsets.

Employability enhancement
During our interaction with the HR managers and CEO of the companies, we expressed our willingness to intern and work with them.
The mentors of the industries liked our batch and offered us
assistance for future internships and placements
. They connected with us via their social media handles like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook. The industrial visits proved to be a great platform for networking.
I am grateful for this opportunity that helped me see the world in a different and realistic manner. Thanks to my alma mater, UPES, for planning it so well and adding value to my BBA journey.
