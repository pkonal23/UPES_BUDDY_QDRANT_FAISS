Prof. Rahul Silori

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Prof. Rahul Silori is a distinguished expert in Environmental Engineering, focusing particularly on emerging contaminants and innovative remediation approaches. He stands out as one of the few researchers working on wastewater and water studies, with a keen interest in treatment perspectives. Prof. Silori delves into water quality and quantity, extensively covering various aquatic environmental compartments. His expertise lies in the environmental geochemistry of heavy metals, notably conducting research on Chromium leaching into groundwater from dumping sites of tanning industries in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, he quantifies various emerging contaminants, including pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) and microplastics (MPs). He actively engages in consultancy related to environmental and geotechnical engineering.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Prof. Rahul held the position of Assistant Professor at the Civil Engineering Department of Tula’s Institute, Dehradun. He has been associated with UPES since 2016, accumulating seven and a half years of experience.
Research Interests
Prof. Rahul's research interests encompass Water and Wastewater studies, Environmental geochemistry of heavy metals and other contaminants, Emerging contaminants, and Remediation Approaches.
Teaching Philosophy
Prof. Rahul possesses eight years of teaching experience, instructing various core engineering and multidisciplinary courses at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In the classroom, he employs research-aided methodology to acquaint students with state-of-the-art engineering practices. He effectively blends physical and online modes of teaching to enhance the learning experience. Prof. Silori utilizes physical models to illustrate concepts, believing that visualization deeply impacts students. He integrates real-life projects into teaching, promoting practical thinking beyond theory.
Courses Taught
Prof. Rahul has taught diverse courses in civil engineering and other engineering domains. His domain expertise is evident in teaching core environmental engineering courses such as Environmental Engineering, Advanced Environmental Engineering, Water Supply, Sanitation & Refugee Health, and Disaster Management. Additionally, he has actively taught courses in Soil Mechanics, Foundation Engineering, Project Cost Analysis, Building Materials, Construction, and Advanced Construction Techniques to civil engineering and other engineering students.
Awards and Grants
Prof. Rahul's research titled “Global groundwater vulnerability for Pharmaceutical and Personal care products (PPCPs): The scenario of the second decade of the 21st Century” has been featured in the Science for Environment Policy news service by the European Commission's Environment Directorate-General. He has also received a research grant of Rs. 60,000 for the project “Investigation of the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds as an emerging contaminant in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Dehradun city and remediation approaches” under UPES, Dehradun's SEED-2022 research grant program (Project no. UPES/R&D-SOE/07032022/10).
Scholarly Activities
Prof. Rahul is an active researcher with approximately 20 research publications in esteemed journals/publishers, including high-impact journals (Impact factor > 10). Additionally, he serves as a reviewer for various prestigious journals such as Environmental Research, Groundwater for Sustainable Development, and Total Environment Research Themes, among others.
