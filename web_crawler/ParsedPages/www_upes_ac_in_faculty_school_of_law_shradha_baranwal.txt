Her research journey also includes a brief association with leading law publishing houses as editor and a coveted project with National Human Rights Commission on ‘
Gender Justice and the Indian Constitution
’. She has published papers in UGC care-listed journals and with national and international publishers. Along with research, she has constantly been a part of various training programs and FDPs wherein she has been updating and rediscovering the changing dimensions and needs of legal education. Ms. Shradha graduated in law from the University of Delhi and thereafter pursued LL.M. from the National Law School of India University, Bangalore. Ms. Shradha is also UGC NET qualified. Currently, she is pursuing her doctorate from Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Patiala.
Along with academic formal learning, Ms. Shradha has been an ardent observer of legal developments in the country and holds a keen interest in the legal history of India and governance issues. Off late Ms. Shradha has developed an interest in the interface between law and religion and is focusing on the same in her research endeavors.
