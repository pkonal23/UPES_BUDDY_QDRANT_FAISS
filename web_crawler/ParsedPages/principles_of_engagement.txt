26 I Principle of Engagement

All faculty members shall be on probation for a period of 1 year, from the date of joining. However, in case a
faculty member demonstrates exceptional performance, s/he may be confirmed after 6 months of joining,
subject to assessment of performance and approval by the Approving Authority indicated in Performance
Review and Confirmation Process.
All non-faculty members shall be on probation for 6 months, from the date of joining.
Reporting Manager should discuss the performance expectations, goals and KRAs with the new employee,
within 30 days of his / her joining, and the same should be documented by the employee and signed-off by
the Reporting Manager. These goals and KRAs would form the basis of performance review process during
the Probation period.
HR should interact with the new employees on regular intervals to understand if the employees have
acclimatized to the culture and environment and address any issues which the employees might have.

Performance Review and Confirmation Process

All employees are confirmed only on successful completion of probation, which is ascertained through
on-going monitoring, periodic performance reviews and confirmation process.
UPES follows a two-fold review process for confirmation of employees, which is detailed below:
a.
An Interim Performance Review will be conducted by the Reporting Manager, along with a feedback
discussion, post completion of 90 days.
b.
Additionally, as part of the confirmation process, Probation Assessment shall be undertaken by the
Reporting Manager and the approving authority.
•
Probation Assessment will be conducted twice over the Probation period for faculty member,
once at 6 months’ milestone, and then on completion of 1 year.
•
For non-faculty members, Probation Assessment will be conducted towards the end of the
probation period, i.e. on completion of 6 months.
The above review process may be clubbed with Mid Term Review / Final Appraisal process, as applicable.
Final approving authority for all confirmation cases is Vice Chancellor.
Probation Assessment process should be initiated one month prior to the 6 months and 1-year milestones
(as applicable); this would provide sufficient time to all stakeholders involved to complete the performance
review and discussion, while also ensuring timely completion of the process.
Each performance review / assessment should be documented by the employee, Reporting Manager,
using the Performance Review Form.
It is the responsibility of the Reporting Manager / Dean/ Functional Head to ensure timely
submission of the filled form, along with their decision, to HR for further processing.
Based on the assessment and decision of the Approving Authority, HR will issue a Probation Confirmation
Letter or Probation Extension Letter to the employee, post sign-off from the Approving Authority.
The Probation Confirmation Letter / Probation Extension Letter should be issued to the employee within 15
