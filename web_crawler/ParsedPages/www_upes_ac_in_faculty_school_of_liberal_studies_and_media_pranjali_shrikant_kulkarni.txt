Pranjali Shrikant Kulkarni

Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Pranjali Kulkarni is an academic working in Cognitive and Brain Sciences for the past 9 years. Her research interest lies in analyzing core concepts and methodologies of language research through the lens of Psychology and the Philosophy of Science.
Pranjali has an academic background of interdisciplinary research. She has pursued her under graduation from Tata institute of Social Sciences Hyderabad and further moved to do her MSc in Cognitive Science at IIT Gandhinagar. With curious inclination towards understanding mysteries of language cognition and philosophy of science, Pranjali joined IIT Gandhinagar for PhD in Cognitive and Brain Sciences. Her doctoral research emphasizes understanding the formation and perception of linguistic meanings within Cognitive Science. She identified challenges in experimental research on linguistic meanings, which were influenced by structuralist approaches. Her work advocates for a context-driven understanding of linguistic meanings, drawing upon Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophical framework.
Pranjali’s diverse interdisciplinary research experience includes evaluating mental health initiatives with The Ratan Tata Trust, studying benefit misallocation among Scheduled Tribes, and analyzing Bharatanatyam dance movements using motion capture technology at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Her contributions to academic conferences include presentations on second language acquisition and alternative methodologies in cognitive science.
Work Experience
Pranjali has extensive academic and research experience as a Teaching Assistant at IIT Gandhinagar. In the Cognitive Neuroscience course, she focused on the language module focusing on neural foundations of language processing.  As a Teaching Assistant for the Writing Course, she emphasized communication skills, and in Cognitive Psychology, she explored language acquisition and cognitive development. As a Graduate Teaching Fellow for "Embodied Cognition and Methods of Phenomenology," she delivered guest lectures on Cognitive Linguistics and Language and the Brain. Additionally, Pranjali optimized tools at ReMaterials Ahmedabad and analyzed machine scoring of student essays at Playpower Labs.
Research Interests
Pranjali's research interests center on language and meaning within the realms of cognition and the Philosophy of Science. She employs insights from Wittgenstein to explore how context influences linguistic meanings and their implications for human cognition. By challenging traditional structuralist approaches, she advocates for a context-driven perspective that embraces subjective interpretations and embodied experiences. Pranjali is dedicated to examining how philosophical inquiries can inform empirical research in cognitive science, particularly regarding the nature of meaning. Her future projects will investigate the implications of language processing systems in artificial intelligence, focusing on decision-making and ethical considerations in the intersection of language and cognition.
Teaching Philosophy
Pranjali's teaching philosophy emphasizes interdisciplinary learning and the development of conceptual strength in Psychology and Cognition. She believes education should be tailored to each student’s needs, creating a classroom where. curiosity thrives. By guiding undergraduate students in research skills and advanced inquiries, she aims to foster intellectual growth and prepare a new generation of researchers who can analyze concepts from multiple perspectives. Pranjali combines methodological rigor with innovative teaching strategies, breaking down complex topics into accessible units. Her interactive methods in language processing and brain-behavior relationships encourage students to connect theory with real-world applications, empowering them to tackle diverse research challenges confidently
Courses Taught
As a Graduate Teaching Fellow at IIT Gandhinagar, Pranjali led the postgraduate course Embodied Cognition and Methods of Phenomenology, emphasizing the role of embodied experiences in cognitive processes. She delivered guest lectures across various postgraduate courses, including Cognitive Linguistics, where she explored the historical context and core tenets of the field. In the Introduction to Linguistics course, she discussed Language and the Brain, focusing on how brain research informs our understanding of language. In the Writing Course, she guided students in developing essential academic reading skills. Additionally, her guest lecture in Cognitive Psychology addressed Early Language Acquisition and the complexities of cracking the speech code.
Awards and Grants
Pranjali was awarded silver medal for second highest score in BASS program at TISS Hyderabad. She was also awarded gold medal for highest score in MSc at IITGn. Recipient of project scholarship for re-inventing Japan Project- JAIST-India Cooperative Program for frontier scientists with Global Sense in Advanced Science and Technology.
Scholarly Activities
Pranjali's scholarly activities reflect her research interests in cognitive sciences and language acquisition. During her internship at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), she studied skilled movements in Bharatanatyam using motion capture technology, highlighting her focus on embodied cognition. She has actively engaged in various conferences, including the National Seminar on Creating Safety Nets for Adolescents and Youths and the Annual Meeting of the Association for Cognitive Science, where she explored contemporary research. At the National Symposium on Cognitive Science, she presented a poster on Second Language Acquisition and investigated Wittgenstein’s methodology at the International Symposium on Bilingualism and Cognition. Her participation in workshops on Design Interventions for Large-Scale Social Concerns and discussions on Artificial Wisdom underscores her commitment to applying cognitive principles to real-world challenges. Additionally, her roles as a teaching assistant and head student coordinator for The Fall School of Language further enhance her interdisciplinary approach within academia.
