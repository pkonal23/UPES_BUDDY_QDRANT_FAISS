Nano biosensor for detection of chlorpyrifos in the milk sample

Akash Jain & Arsh Bansal, students pursuing 4th year in Bachelor of Pharmacy worked on fabricating a biosensor that can detect and quantify the pesticide present in milk, specifically Chlorpyrifos Pesticide. Chlorpyrifos Pesticide is used extensively in Agriculture to control pest manifestation. The disproportionate use of such compounds may increase the risk of mortality and environmental pollution, adding to which Ops account for neurotoxic disorders in humans.
Students quoted that there has been little, or no work has been done on the detection of Pesticides in milk. Therefore, we choose this project since it has high scope and can solve the affordability problem.
We were introduced to this project by our guide, Dr. Jyoti Upadhyay, Assistant professor, SOHST, and Dr. Ashish Mathur, Senior associate professor, CIDRI, R&D UPES. in the timeline of our study, we have received all possible help from School and Research & Development Team (R&D). Since, it was truly a new field for us, and having little to no idea about the biosensors, our guides have helped us a lot in every step of research, from explaining about every little thing to guiding us in every step of the study.
