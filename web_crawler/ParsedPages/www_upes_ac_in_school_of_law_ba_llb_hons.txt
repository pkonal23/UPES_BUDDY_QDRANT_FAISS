This will help us create a learning space which meets the unique needs of every student.

In the coming years, we aim to focus on digital learning through a balanced combination of technology, digital content, live instruction and experiential learning. Our partnerships with global institutions would provide our students with much-needed 'international exposure at home'. We have the privilege of becoming the first Indian university to partner with the UK-based University of Law. School of Law, UPES and UK-based The University of Law (ULaw), one of the most reputed universities for legal studies globally, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that aims to provide opportunities to students such as –

Scholarships for postgraduate programs

Faculty and student exchange

Online modules

Summer school program

Research collaboration

Collaborative seminars, moot courts, conferences and student competitions.

We also have MoUs with renowned institutions such as Maurer School of Law and Nottingham Trent University to provide progression opportunities for higher education. The School of Law, UPES has taken another step towards bridging the gap between industry and academia. In line with the guidelines released by the University Grants Commission, we have appointed top legal practitioners as Professors of Practice to inculcate practical skills to students through their vast industry experience. Finally, the program offers unmatched global opportunities, ensuring students are well-prepared for the international legal market.
