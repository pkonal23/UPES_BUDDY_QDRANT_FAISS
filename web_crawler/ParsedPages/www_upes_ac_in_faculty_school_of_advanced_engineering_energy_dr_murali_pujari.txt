Dr. Murali Pujari

Assistant Professor (SG)

Profile Summary
Dr. Murali Pujari earned his doctoral degree from the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India, in 2015. The title of his thesis is 'Combinatorial plating characteristics of electroless processes for dense Pd-PSS composite membrane fabrication.
He possesses excellent expertise in wastewater treatment and membrane-based separation processes. His research works have been published in numerous reputed journals (16), patents (2), and conferences (3). In recognition of his contributions, he was awarded the best paper award at the International Conference on GCRAM 2022.
Currently, Dr. Pujari teaches undergraduate courses such as Mass Transfer Operations, Chemical Reaction Engineering, Heat Transfer, Material and Energy Balance Computations, Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering, and Petroleum Refining Technology.
Work Experience
Dr. Murali Pujari possesses 13 years of cumulative research, teaching, and industrial experience in Chemical Engineering fields. Previously, he held the position of Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Jaipur National University in Jaipur. Before pursuing his PhD, he worked as a Production Officer at Raks Pharma Visakhapatnam.
Research Interests
Dr. Pujari's research interests encompass Membrane-based separation processes, Electroless and Electroplating for deposition of metal films, Wastewater treatment, and Hydrogen separation by novel supported palladium membranes.
Teaching Philosophy
With over thirteen years of experience as a teacher and researcher, Dr. Murali Pujari strives to design and deliver teaching materials that enhance the quality of student learning. He adopts innovative teaching methodologies and visual aids to effectively deliver the course content. Dr. Pujari actively encourages student participation by bridging the gap between students and teachers, fostering an environment conducive to questioning and learning from the teacher. He promotes interactive learning by encouraging bright students to present and write-ups based on their academic performance, thereby improving their communication skills and knowledge. For weaker students, he provides extra attention and care to boost their confidence and facilitate interactive learning.
Courses Taught
Dr. Murali Pujari has taught core chemical engineering subjects, including Mass Transfer Operations, Chemical Reaction Engineering, Heat Transfer, Material and Energy Balance Computations, Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering, Thermodynamic and Phase Behavior, and Petroleum Refining Technology.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Murali Pujari received a UGC fellowship and an Institute (MHRD) research fellowship (IIT Guwahati) during his M.Tech. and PhD. He successfully developed a method for fabricating inexpensive dense Pd/PSS composite membranes during his doctoral research, which was granted an Indian patent. Additionally, he published 12 SCI papers during that time. Furthermore, he was awarded the first prize for the best paper presentation of the session at the international conference GCRASM 2022 in Mangalore, Karnataka, India.
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Murali Pujari has a robust track record in proposing state-of-the-art research, designing and building experimental facilities, developing standard operating procedures (SOP), conducting experiments, and analysing results. He has published numerous peer-reviewed journal papers and has taken up various responsibilities such as Activity Coordinator, Course Coordinator, and Placement in-charge Coordinator, among others.
