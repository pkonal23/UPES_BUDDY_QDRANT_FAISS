Profile Summary
Dr. Divya Tripathi is a passionate fly researcher. Ph.D. (Biomedical Engineering) from Indian Institute of Technology aiming to work in state-of-the-art facilities for teaching and research; strong in logic and conceptual intelligence and has performed several research & published publications. She is Skilled in Molecular Biology, Formulation Development, and Characterization techniques; certified in small-animal imaging modalities (PET/SPECT) for translational preclinical studies; clinical studies and knowledge in animal handling. She is Proficient at performing pilot studies; design & synthesis of in-vitro and in-vivo biological experimentation; statistical design, and analysis of experiments. She has obtained various professional certifications and attended various scientific workshops and training. She has exposure to overall research and development of projects, right from planning, cost controls, risk mitigation, resource mobilization, and structured communications to final reviews within cost & time parameters
Research Instruments: Experienced in Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTIR), • Hands-on Experience Small Animal Experimental Models Ø Lung: Inflammation, Fibrosis (Diagnosis and Treatment), Lung: Inflammation model using Radiation and Acid, Acid-Induced Lung Injury Model Ø Radiation-Induced Lung Injury Model Ø Wound Models: Burn, Incision, Excision, radiation, acid wound models Ø Efficacy testing of various drugs Ø Animal Dosing Techniques: Oral, subcutaneous(SQ), intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), and intraperitoneal (IP), retro-orbital plexus
Work Experience
Prior to joining UPES, Dr. Divya Tripathi worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the World Health organization-central for disease control -USA, in affiliation with South Asian University, Ministry of External Affairs, Chanakyapuri, Delhi, on “Research and Development of point-of-care testing (POCT) for Measles and Rubella Diagnosis.” She also worked with the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Defence Research and Development Organization, Delhi, on “Biomedical Devices & Formulations for combat casualty management.”
Research Interests
Dr. Divya Tripathi’s research interest is in contributing to a deeper understanding of Various aspects of Biology and engineering towards health care. She employs the design of various biomedical devices and formulation development.
Biomedical devices
Lab on chip
Radiology
Formulation development
Polymer chemistry
Artificial Intelligence
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Tripathi considers (1) Predicting the subject (or science here) as a definite live procedure and (2) individualizing one’s own learning experiences as the two most important criteria of effective learning and understanding of the subject. She has developed a newfound method-based core curriculum for undergraduates and graduate students to expand knowledge of bio instrumentation, biomedical engineering, Bioimaging, and clinical monitoring and regulations.
