Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. D.P. Singh has been awarded his Ph.D. thesis titled ‘Investigation of the Role of Break-up Processes in Heavy Ion Reactions Below 7 MeV/Nucleon; in Experimental Nuclear Physics in 2010 from the Department of Physics, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh in collaboration with Inter University Accelerator Centre New Delhi. He has also been awarded his M.Phil. titled ‘Analysis of Fractional Quantum Hall Effect’ in 2003 from the Department of Physics, Institute of Basic Sciences, Khandari, Agra. After completing his Ph.D., he has been engaged in teaching and research at various institutions. He has also completed two funded research projects sanctioned by SERB-DST Government of India. One student has been awarded a Ph.D. Degree with him. Dr. Singh has published more than 75 research articles in national and international journals of repute and presented more than 100 research papers at national and international conferences and symposia. He is also a Life Member of the Indian Physics Association (IPA) and Indian Association of Physics Teachers (IAPT).
Work Experience
Before joining UPES in November 2014, Dr. Singh worked as Young Scientist (DST-SERB) in the Department of Physics at Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India from July 2012 to November 2014. Along with this, he was also engaged in teaching at the Department of Physics at Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh in the role of guest faculty, and acted as a faculty at Gwalior Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior, India from June 2010 to March 2012. He has also been engaged in teaching activities at the Department of Physics, Sri Varshney Degree College, Aligarh, India July 2001–June 2002 & July 2003–June 2004.
Research Interests
Dr. Singh is interested in Nuclear Reaction Mechanism through various nuclear reactions viz; pre-equilibrium emission, fusion, and fission reactions, etc., using light and heavy ion interactions at energies near the Coulomb barrier to the well above it (below 10MeV/nucleon). He is also interested in Surface activity Measurements using Thin Layer Activation technique using light and heavy charged particles referred over conventional surface phenomena measurement methods. Furthermore, in the production of various radionuclides, applicable in advanced technological tools used in nuclear medicine. A reliable pathway for the production of these radionuclides is required to meet the high demand for these isotopes.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Singh strongly believes that teaching is an opportunity for continual learning and growth and the most effective way to transfer knowledge. Physics can be learned more efficiently only when both teacher and students enjoy what they are discussing. To achieve efficient learning by students, he uses a combination of formal lecture periods and smaller discussion sections. He employs various assessment strategies to fairly assess students’ learning. Dr. Singh treats his students with the utmost respect and generates a friendly environment so that the students can candidly discuss topics that they might otherwise be hesitant to address.
Courses Taught
As a physics teacher, Dr. Singh is interested in utilizing his teaching skills for undergraduate and graduate-level students. He has taught various courses such as nuclear & particle physics, Classical Mechanics at undergraduate and graduate levels, and Engineering Physics for B. Tech courses. Further, he is able to teach most of the physics courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, though, he prefers to teach courses on Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wave Mechanics, Electrodynamics, etc. He also envisions teaching and developing research-oriented electives based on his research background for the needs of MSc/MTech, Ph.D. students including Experimental techniques in Nuclear Physics.

He employs various assessment strategies to fairly assess students’ learning. Dr. Singh treats his students with the utmost respect and generates a friendly environment so that the students can candidly discuss topics that they might otherwise be hesitant to address.
Courses Taught
As a physics teacher, Dr. Singh is interested in utilizing his teaching skills for undergraduate and graduate-level students. He has taught various courses such as nuclear & particle physics, Classical Mechanics at undergraduate and graduate levels, and Engineering Physics for B. Tech courses. Further, he is able to teach most of the physics courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, though, he prefers to teach courses on Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wave Mechanics, Electrodynamics, etc. He also envisions teaching and developing research-oriented electives based on his research background for the needs of MSc/MTech, Ph.D. students including Experimental techniques in Nuclear Physics.

Profile Summary
Dr. D.P. Singh has been awarded his Ph.D. thesis titled ‘Investigation of the Role of Break-up Processes in Heavy Ion Reactions Below 7 MeV/Nucleon; in Experimental Nuclear Physics in 2010 from the Department of Physics, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh in collaboration with Inter University Accelerator Centre New Delhi. He has also been awarded his M.Phil. titled ‘Analysis of Fractional Quantum Hall Effect’ in 2003 from the Department of Physics, Institute of Basic Sciences, Khandari, Agra. After completing his Ph.D., he has been engaged in teaching and research at various institutions. He has also completed two funded research projects sanctioned by SERB-DST Government of India. One student has been awarded a Ph.D. Degree with him. Dr. Singh has published more than 75 research articles in national and international journals of repute and presented more than 100 research papers at national and international conferences and symposia. He is also a Life Member of the Indian Physics Association (IPA) and Indian Association of Physics Teachers (IAPT).
Work Experience
Before joining UPES in November 2014, Dr. Singh worked as Young Scientist (DST-SERB) in the Department of Physics at Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India from July 2012 to November 2014. Along with this, he was also engaged in teaching at the Department of Physics at Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh in the role of guest faculty, and acted as a faculty at Gwalior Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior, India from June 2010 to March 2012. He has also been engaged in teaching activities at the Department of Physics, Sri Varshney Degree College, Aligarh, India July 2001–June 2002 & July 2003–June 2004.
Research Interests
Dr. Singh is interested in Nuclear Reaction Mechanism through various nuclear reactions viz; pre-equilibrium emission, fusion, and fission reactions, etc., using light and heavy ion interactions at energies near the Coulomb barrier to the well above it (below 10MeV/nucleon). He is also interested in Surface activity Measurements using Thin Layer Activation technique using light and heavy charged particles referred over conventional surface phenomena measurement methods. Furthermore, in the production of various radionuclides, applicable in advanced technological tools used in nuclear medicine. A reliable pathway for the production of these radionuclides is required to meet the high demand for these isotopes.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Singh strongly believes that teaching is an opportunity for continual learning and growth and the most effective way to transfer knowledge. Physics can be learned more efficiently only when both teacher and students enjoy what they are discussing.
