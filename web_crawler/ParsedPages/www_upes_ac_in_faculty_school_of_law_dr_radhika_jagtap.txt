Post doctorate, she continues to research and write extensively in the areas of Gender Justice and Feminist Jurisprudence, Public International Law and Labour Laws.

Dr. Radhika’s thesis, which she defended in 2021, explored the discursive and theoretical relation between Social Movements and the discipline of Public International Law. Through the same, she inquired the regional politics of international law, feminist movements and pre independence movements from India to favour a hypothesis that the theorisation of non-western histories of international law are underwritten. Post doctorate, she continues to research and write extensively in the areas of Gender Justice and Feminist Jurisprudence, Public International Law and Labour Laws.

Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Radhika trusts immensely in collaborative and student-centric approaches of teaching. She firmly believes in “study to sensitise” and looks at academia as a continuous learning process for the student as well as the teacher, especially one that promotes for making individuals autonomous in life and critical in thinking.
