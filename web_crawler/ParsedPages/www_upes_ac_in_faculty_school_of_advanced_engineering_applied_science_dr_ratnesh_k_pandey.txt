Assistant Professor (SG)

Profile Summary
Dr. Pandey is an accomplished researcher and professor with a strong background in accelerator-based research, ion-induced material modification, surface nanostructuring, radiation damage, nanoclusters, and density functional methods. He obtained his Ph.D. in Physics from the Nanotechnology Application Centre at the University of Allahabad, India. With over 8 years of experience in academia, he has made significant contributions to the field of materials science and technology, evident from his impressive publication record of 30 publications and an H-index of 10. Dr. Pandey has successfully secured research funding for several projects, including those investigating the radiation stability of tungsten carbide nanostructures for fusion reactor applications, and studies on 2D materials and transition metal-doped nanosheets for supercapacitor applications. Moreover, he is actively involved in the development of a gas sensing system through government and UPES funding. Besides his research accomplishments, Dr. Pandey has undertaken positions of responsibility as a course coordinator and team member for accreditation documentation. Additionally, he also organises international conferences and webinars.
Work Experience
Dr. Pandey's diverse work experience includes being a Beam Time User at the Material Science Beam Line of the Inter University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi, from 2009 to 2015 and from 2021 to the present. He has also been a Visitor Scholar at Michigan Technological University, USA, where he conducted research on small fluoride clusters. In the academic field, he has held the positions of Assistant Professor (2016-2019), Assistant Professor- Senior Scale (2019-2023), and Assistant Professor- Selection Grade (2023- Present) at UPES.
