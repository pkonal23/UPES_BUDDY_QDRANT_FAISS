She worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher within the MISL group in the School of Computer Science and Information Technology, University College Cork, Ireland from June 2020 to November 2021. She completed her PhD in 2020 from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT (BHU) Varanasi, India. She received M.Tech. degree in Information Technology from IIIT Allahabad, India; and a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Jaipur National University, Jaipur. Throughout her career, she has published various research papers in reputable journals and has had the privilege of presenting her findings at international conferences and workshops.
Work Experience
She joined UPES in January 2022, as her first teaching job. Before joining UPES, She worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher within the MISL group in the School of Computer Science and Information Technology, University College Cork, Ireland from June 2020 to November 2021. During PostDoc She worked on a European Union project, The BRAINE Project (Big-Data pRocessing and Artificial Intelligence) that aimed to boost the development of the Edge framework and, specifically, energy-efficient hardware and AI-empowered software systems, capable of processing Big Data at the Edge. She worked with Dell for developing a Scalable Big data Storage solution as part of the project.
Research Interests
Her areas of specialisation include Big Data Processing and Analytics, Data Visualisation, Artificial Intelligence, Fog/Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, and Ubiquitous Computing.
