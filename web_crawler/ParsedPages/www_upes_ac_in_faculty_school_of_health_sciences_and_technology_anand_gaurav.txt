Dr. Anand Gaurav

Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Anand Gaurav obtained his bachelor’s degree from Sardar Patel University, India, master’s from Indian Institute of Information Technology-Allahabad and the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, and PhD from Shobhit University, India. He has also completed Post Graduate Diploma in Tertiary Teaching from UCSI University, Malaysia. Before joining UPES, he taught at various institutions in India, Malaysia, Maldives, and Suriname. Dr. Anand Gaurav’s area of research expertise is computer-aided drug design and synthesis of drugs and small molecules of biological interest. His current research focuses on the design of selective phosphodiesterase 4B inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents and dual phosphodiesterase 1B/10A inhibitors as anti-schizophrenia drugs. He has obtained several research grants amounting to more than 300,000 Malaysian ringgits, including that from the ministry of higher education, Malaysia.
He has published over 50 publications in journals of international repute i.e., Journal of Molecular Liquids, Computers in Biology and Medicine, Pharmaceuticals, Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics, RSC Advances, PLOS One, etc. He is on the editorial board of international journals such as PLOS One and Frontiers in Drug Discovery. He serves as a reviewer for many journals of significant reputation, including Medicinal Chemistry Research, PLOS ONE, Journal of Molecular Modeling, Future Drugs, Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics etc.
Work Experience
Prior to joining UPES, Dr. Anand Gaurav was working as Associate Professor at UCSI University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. During his stint at UCSI University, he has served at several positions like Head of Research, Head of Postgraduate and Research, and Vice Chair of the Student Welfare Committee. He has also been a Visiting Professor to Villa College, Maldives, and Anton De Kom Universiteit van Suriname, South America.
Research Interests
Dr. Anand Gaurav’s research interests contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of phosphodiesterase (PDEs) inhibitors in treating CNS disorders and respiratory disorders via computational and experimental methods. He employs computational drug design tools such as QSAR, pharmacophore modeling, docking, virtual screening and molecular dynamics to understand better the inhibition of some variants of PDE, such as PDE1B, PDE10A, and PDE4 by small molecules.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Anand Gaurav has used a combination of feedback from students and colleagues, self-reflection on his own experiences, and focus on continuing education via professional platforms and tertiary teaching program to define his teaching philosophy, i.e., “role of the instructor is to enable knowledge acquisition and foster mastery in the learners including augmenting understanding and encouraging curiosity in the learners. Thus, the goal includes enabling learners to become proficient in the basics of a topic, to develop the ability to think and shape opinion independently, and synthesize, evaluate, and effectively communicate information.”
Courses Taught
Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Biochemistry for Pharmacy, Drug Discovery, and Development.

Research Interests
Dr. Anand Gaurav’s research interests contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of phosphodiesterase (PDEs) inhibitors in treating CNS disorders and respiratory disorders via computational and experimental methods. He employs computational drug design tools such as QSAR, pharmacophore modeling, docking, virtual screening and molecular dynamics to understand better the inhibition of some variants of PDE, such as PDE1B, PDE10A, and PDE4 by small molecules.
