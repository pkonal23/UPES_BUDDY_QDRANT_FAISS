Social Internship - Srijan
UPES is one of the few universities in India that offer social internships in the first year to all students, irrespective of their field of study. While UPES has conducted social internships in the past, what makes Srijan unique is that it is a mandatory six-week-long social internship. It firmly puts the ‘social’ at the centre of learning for university students. It drives home the point that the core purpose of education is to better the lives of others and the community as a whole. Social internships introduce students to the society and its challenges and create value systems of service, giving, empathy and respect for those who are less fortunate.
