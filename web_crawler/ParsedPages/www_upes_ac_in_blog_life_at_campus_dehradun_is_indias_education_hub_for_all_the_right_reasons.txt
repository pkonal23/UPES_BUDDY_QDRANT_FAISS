Dehradun is India’s Education Hub for All the Right Reasons
By a Correspondent
Published 20/08/2019
Dehradun is synonymous to education. This beautiful city with Himalayan ranges in the backdrop is dubbed as India’s education hub and carries the label of “school capital of India”. In the last decade, this city has tremendously evolved not just as the education hub of Uttarakhand but all North India as well. Prominent personalities like Rajiv Gandhi, Abhinav Bindra, and Amitav Ghosh have received their education from some of the revered institutions of Dehradun.
The beautiful city of Dehradun also has opportunities for part-time jobs.
From law to engineering, management to medicine and pharmacy to design, there is a college or university to learn just about anything. Dehradun saw a threefold increase in a span of eight years in the number of management and engineering colleges according to a recent survey by the Higher Education Department of Uttarakhand Government.
When it comes to building a career in Dehradun, the opportunities are ample. With a good number of viable options, Dehradun offers jobs in the fields of wildlife, education, biodiversity, healthcare, law and a lot more. Recently, Dehradun was ranked 3rd by
ASSOCHAM
in the list of 3-Tier cities that have shown remarkable growth in terms of employment opportunities.
The beautiful city of Dehradun also has opportunities for part-time jobs. Nature lovers can get associated with several NGOs as volunteers to work for biodiversity. Be it Raahat Foundation or People for Animals; there are many options to choose from.
Other than that, Dehradun offers a variety of adventure sports including paragliding, river rafting, bungee jumping, swimming and ice skating. There are ample opportunities for cricket, basketball, football and many other sports.
Active participation in recreational activities and sports has a positive impact on mental health. Australia’s Department of Sports and Recreation briefly found links between physical inactivity, obesity and depression.
The fresh and healthy environment of the city helps in performing better in life while the ample opportunities make living in this city fun.
Dehradun is one destination where learning is promoted in the best possible way, thus is known as India’s education hub. The fresh and healthy environment of the city helps in performing better in life while the ample opportunities make living in this city fun.
To conclude, it is advantageous to study in Dehradun – the education hub of Uttarakhand, from a career point of view. We at UPES believe in offering the best of education and hence offers the students a carefully crafted curriculum for all the courses and specializations. The curriculum is designed in a way that it makes the students industry-ready and loaded with all the knowledge they require off the field. At UPES, we dream about our students graduating and moving on to the real world with heads held high and solid careers in hand. Our placement record is the testimony to our commitment towards providing world-class education and career path to our students.

In the last decade, this city has tremendously evolved not just as the education hub of Uttarakhand but all North India as well. Prominent personalities like Rajiv Gandhi, Abhinav Bindra, and Amitav Ghosh have received their education from some of the revered institutions of Dehradun.
