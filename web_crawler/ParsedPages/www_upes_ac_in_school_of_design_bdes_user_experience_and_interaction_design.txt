program is an Industry Internship program. This program provides students with a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience and apply their knowledge and expertise in real-world situations. The program assigns students to summer internships and final-year dissertation projects at various UX industries and brands. During these internships, students will have the chance to work on real projects, collaborate with experienced professionals in their field, and gain exposure to contemporary design principles and practices.
Furthermore, the Industry Internship program also offers students the chance to establish professional connections and gain a deeper understanding of the latest trends and developments in the industry. Overall, the
B.Des. (User Experience & Interaction Design)
program is an excellent choice for students looking to pursue a career in interaction design, as it provides them with a well-rounded education, hands-on experience, and opportunities to network and stay updated with the latest trends and practices in the industry.
Program Highlights

Future Scope / Industry Trends
The future of the
B.Des. (User Experience & Interaction Design)
program looks promising as the field of UX/UI design is rapidly growing and is expected to expand further in the coming years. Companies are increasingly focusing on digital platforms, making the importance of UX/UI design in creating successful digital products and services more evident. This shift towards user-centred design and digital transformation is predicted to significantly increase the demand for UX/UI designers from 2023 to 2025, particularly in the areas of mobile applications, website design, and other digital products.
