India takes pole position in drug manufacturing
Dr. Manish Gupta
Published 14/04/2021
India has everything it takes to become the pharmacy of the world. UPES School of Health Sciences has designed programs according to the needs of the pharmaceutical industry
India is considered the next healthcare superpower. During the pandemic, major pharma companies showed their faith in Indian manufacturing facilities for the production of the COVID-19 vaccine. India has played an important role in the manufacturing of two vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin). Covishield is the vaccine made by Oxford University in partnership with AstraZeneca. It was found to have an average efficacy of 70.4%. It is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin was developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology. It is India’s first home-produced vaccine against COVID-19.
China is the biggest manufacturer and supplier of APIs and intermediates that are the key precursors for the manufacturing of any finished pharmaceutical product. The current COVID-19 crisis is responsible for the supply chain disruption, which has severely affected the inventory levels of most pharmaceutical companies. Many pharmaceutical companies are struggling and trying their level best to maintain the production of their formulations. It seems the perfect opportunity for Indian manufacturers for taking advantage of this situation. Hydroxychloroquine was manufactured and exported to the countries, which demanded to deal with the  COVID-19 crisis. It is a clear example of taking the position of a global leader in the field of pharma manufacturing by India.
India exported worth USD 19.14 billion of pharmaceutical entities including bulk drugs, intermediates, drug formulations, biologicals, herbal products, and surgical products in 2019. India currently manufactures 20% of all generic products needed by the world.  The ‘Make in India’ concept would help India to become self-sufficient in the process of bulk manufacturing of drugs. It will also help us in gaining control from Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API manufacturing) to generic formulation preparation.
India is famous for its low-cost yet high-quality pharmaceutical products. It is only possible due to the best infrastructural facilities and competent manpower supported by efficient government policies. India has the highest number of FDA-approved manufacturing plants, after the US. In recent years, India is becoming a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. There are several start-ups, which have conducted research, manufactured and launched world-class pharmaceutical products. International investors are looking forward to collaborating with Indian manufacturers in all capacities. The Indian government is keen to boost investments, partnerships, and increase the ease of doing business in India.
India has everything it takes to become the pharmacy of the world. In UPES School of Health Sciences, we have designed programs to meet the needs of the domestic as well as the international pharmaceutical industry.

India takes pole position in drug manufacturing
Dr. Manish Gupta
Published 14/04/2021
India has everything it takes to become the pharmacy of the world. UPES School of Health Sciences has designed programs according to the needs of the pharmaceutical industry
India is considered the next healthcare superpower. During the pandemic, major pharma companies showed their faith in Indian manufacturing facilities for the production of the COVID-19 vaccine. India has played an important role in the manufacturing of two vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin). Covishield is the vaccine made by Oxford University in partnership with AstraZeneca. It was found to have an average efficacy of 70.4%. It is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin was developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology. It is India’s first home-produced vaccine against COVID-19.
China is the biggest manufacturer and supplier of APIs and intermediates that are the key precursors for the manufacturing of any finished pharmaceutical product. The current COVID-19 crisis is responsible for the supply chain disruption, which has severely affected the inventory levels of most pharmaceutical companies. Many pharmaceutical companies are struggling and trying their level best to maintain the production of their formulations. It seems the perfect opportunity for Indian manufacturers for taking advantage of this situation. Hydroxychloroquine was manufactured and exported to the countries, which demanded to deal with the  COVID-19 crisis. It is a clear example of taking the position of a global leader in the field of pharma manufacturing by India.
India exported worth USD 19.14 billion of pharmaceutical entities including bulk drugs, intermediates, drug formulations, biologicals, herbal products, and surgical products in 2019. India currently manufactures 20% of all generic products needed by the world.  The ‘Make in India’ concept would help India to become self-sufficient in the process of bulk manufacturing of drugs. It will also help us in gaining control from Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API manufacturing) to generic formulation preparation.
India is famous for its low-cost yet high-quality pharmaceutical products. It is only possible due to the best infrastructural facilities and competent manpower supported by efficient government policies. India has the highest number of FDA-approved manufacturing plants, after the US. In recent years, India is becoming a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. There are several start-ups, which have conducted research, manufactured and launched world-class pharmaceutical products. International investors are looking forward to collaborating with Indian manufacturers in all capacities. The Indian government is keen to boost investments, partnerships, and increase the ease of doing business in India.
India has everything it takes to become the pharmacy of the world. In UPES School of Health Sciences, we have designed programs to meet the needs of the domestic as well as the international pharmaceutical industry.
