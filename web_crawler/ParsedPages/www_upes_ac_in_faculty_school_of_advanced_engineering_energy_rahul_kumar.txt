Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Rahul Kumar holds a master's degree (M. Tech) from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and earned his PhD from Jaypee University of Engineering & Technology in Madhya Pradesh. With 13 years of experience in teaching and research, he has mentored numerous students pursuing higher education. His primary research area is particle engineering through crystallization, and his work has resulted in the publication of several research papers in both national and international journals. Dr. Rahul Kumar has also presented multiple research papers at national and international conferences. Apart from academia, his hobby includes reading world classical literature.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Dr. Rahul Kumar worked as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Jaypee University of Engineering & Technology Guna, Madhya Pradesh, from 2009 to 2013.
Research Interests
Dr. Rahul Kumar's research group is actively engaged in the following projects:
Antisolvent crystallization for engineering particle characteristics such as morphology, polymorphs, average particle size, and particle size distribution.
Pilot Scale study of bioactive compound extraction using supercritical CO2.
Measurement of solubility of pharmaceutical compounds in mono and binary liquid mixtures, including organic compounds in SC CO2.
Co-crystallization, Encapsulation, and design of novel drug delivery systems for pharmaceutical and herbal compounds.
Estimation of energy consumption to produce micron/nanoparticles in milling, homogenization, and antisolvent crystallization. Material-induced antisolvent crystallization is considered highly efficient from an energy perspective compared to traditional techniques like ball milling and high-pressure homogenization.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Rahul Kumar believes in providing clarity to students about the course objectives and outcomes of his subject. He shares a question booklet based on course outcomes, defined using Bloom's Taxonomy. Alongside classroom teaching, he exposes his students to projects conducted in the departmental lab, fostering better learning through student presentations and mutual teaching among peers, leading to holistic development.
Courses Taught
Dr. Rahul Kumar has taught various courses, including Heat Transfer, Mass Transfer, Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Process dynamics and Control, and Mechanical Operation.
Awards and Grants
He has received two SEED grants from UPES and is currently working on a project titled "Solubility & dissolution rate enhancement of herbal compounds," which is funded by UPES with an approximate amount of 6 lakhs.
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Rahul Kumar actively collaborates with national and international researchers and also contributes as a question paper setter for state universities in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
