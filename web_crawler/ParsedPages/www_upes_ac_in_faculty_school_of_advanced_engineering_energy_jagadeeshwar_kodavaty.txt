Jagadeeshwar Kodavaty

Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Professor Jagadeeshwar Kodavaty is a renowned scholar and researcher in the field of hydrogel characterization, drug release, and rheology of soft materials. His research focuses on the structure and mechanical properties of hydrogels, drug release kinetics in hydrogels, rheological characteristics of soft materials, and enhanced oil recovery methods.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Prof. Kodavaty was associated with Sri Venkateswara Engineering College, which is affiliated with JNTU Hyderabad. He also held a position at the Madanapalle Institute of Technology & Science in the Department of Biotechnology. Prior to that, he was affiliated with Hindustan University, Chennai, and was deputed to Bahrain to represent the University at the ALBA training centre for the purpose of training employees in advanced diploma courses.
Research Interests
His research interests include structure prediction during the preparation of gels, phase separation in solutions and polymer gels, drug release and diffusion in gels, transport phenomena, and Rheology.
Teaching Philosophy
Professor Kodavaty's teaching philosophy is based on the principle that education's ultimate purpose lies in the act of learning and recognizing the diverse ways in which students absorb knowledge. He views teaching and learning as interconnected facets of education. Guided by the conviction that "Imagination is more than knowledge," he employs teaching strategies that kindle students' thinking and imaginative capabilities. His pedagogical approach involves using illustrative examples to highlight crucial concepts, integrating vibrant real-world scenarios.
