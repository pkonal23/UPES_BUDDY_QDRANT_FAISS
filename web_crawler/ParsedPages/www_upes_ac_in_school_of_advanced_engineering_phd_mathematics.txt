Program details
The Ph.D. in Mathematics program at UPES School of Advanced Engineering is a comprehensive and intellectually stimulating research journey that spans a duration of 3-4 years. The program encompasses a diverse range of specialised areas within the broader categories of pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and statistics. In the realm of pure mathematics, students engage in advanced studies in areas such as Algebraic Geometry, where they explore geometric objects defined by algebraic equations, creating a synthesis of algebraic and geometric principles. Number Theory delves into the properties and relationships of numbers, particularly focusing on integers and their unique properties. Topology, another facet of pure mathematics, involves the examination of spatial properties preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending.
The applied mathematics component of the program delves into practical and real-world problem-solving. This includes Fluid Dynamics, where the behavior of fluids and their interactions with solid boundaries are explored. Numerical Analysis involves the development and analysis of algorithms for solving mathematical problems numerically, often leveraging computational tools. Cryptography, a vital aspect of applied mathematics, addresses secure communication and the design of cryptographic algorithms for information protection. Optimization Theory and Operations Research equip students with the skills to find optimal solutions in various decision-making contexts and resource allocation scenarios.
The statistical dimension of the program covers Probability Theory, offering insights into random phenomena and providing a mathematical framework for handling uncertainty. Statistical Inferences enable students to draw meaningful conclusions from data, make predictions, and decisions in uncertain situations. Time Series Analysis equips scholars with the tools to identify patterns and trends in time-ordered data, facilitating predictions for future observations. Multivariate Statistics extends the analysis to datasets with multiple variables, enabling a comprehensive exploration of relationships and patterns. Overall, the Ph.D. in Mathematics at UPES School of Advanced Engineering ensures a rigorous and well-rounded academic experience, fostering cutting-edge research across a spectrum of mathematical disciplines.
