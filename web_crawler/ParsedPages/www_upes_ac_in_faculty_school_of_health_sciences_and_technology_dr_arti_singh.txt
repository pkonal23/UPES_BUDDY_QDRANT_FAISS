She received a prestigious RGNF fellowship for doing a Ph.D. She did her Ph.D. in the identification of “Pharmacological interventions targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in Alzheimer’s disease”. She has also received a prestigious IBRO-APRC Exchange Fellowship for researching “Investigating the role of the Septo-hippocampus in chronic pain”. Her research includes exploring the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, zebrafish neurobehavioral aspects, sleep deprivation, chemobrain, environmental neurotoxicity, and nano neurotherapeutics. She is interested in the identification of epigenetic changes and their role in the progression of neurological diseases. She has received a DST SERB research grant in the amount of 34.25 lacs for Exploring the role of mitochondrial metabolomics in Chemobrain. She is a reviewer of several international journals and a Review Editor in Frontiers Clinical Diabetes journal. She has published over 50 Research and Review Papers in peer-reviewed International and National Journal with Sci, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus indexing. She is also a member of various Neuroscience Societies such as the Indian Academy of Neuroscience (IAN), Society for Neurosciences (SfN), and Society for Alternatives to Animal Experiments-India (SAAE-I).
