Dr. Ratnesh K Pandey - Achievement

Dr. Ratnesh K Pandey - Achievement

Dr. Ratnesh K Pandey, Assistant Professor-Selection Grade in the Applied Science Cluster, has been awarded a prestigious grant of 34 lakhs from the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS), India. Over three years, this project will focus on conducting a comprehensive study of radiation damage in materials for fusion reactor applications.
Fusion reactors hold immense promise as a clean and sustainable energy source, capable of producing vast amounts of electricity with minimal environmental impact. However, one of the significant challenges in realizing this potential lies in developing materials that can withstand the extreme conditions within a fusion reactor, particularly the effects of radiation.
This research will delve into the complex interactions between high-energy particles, such as neutrons and ions, and various candidate materials for fusion reactors. By simulating and analyzing the behavior of these materials under radiation, Dr. Pandey aims to enhance existing understanding of the underlying mechanisms of radiation damage and explore strategies to mitigate its detrimental effects.
The insights gained from the study will contribute to developing advanced materials with improved radiation tolerance, resilience, and longevity. This research could revolutionize the field of fusion energy and accelerate the realization of safe and efficient fusion power plants.
With the generous support of BRNS-India, Dr. Pandey is excited to embark on this scientific journey, collaborating with experts in the field and utilizing state-of-the-art facilities and techniques. He and his research scholars will work tirelessly to advance the knowledge and technologies required for the future of fusion energy, taking us one step closer to a sustainable and carbon-free energy future.
