Here’s why journalists matter to the world today more than ever before
Ekta Kashyap
Published 10/08/2022
Image credit: Pixabay
With an MA in Journalism and Mass Communication, you can power the field of information without fear or favour to give reliable news to the world. The degree opens the door to several opportunities including Features Writer, Digital Media Executive, Content Developer, to name a few
Year 1556. The government of Venice published a monthly written notice to convey information about politics, economics, and military matters throughout Europe. It was called the Notizie scritte, a term that eventually came to mean ‘newspaper’.
However, it was after the invention of the printing press that the world saw its first proper newspaper in the 1600s, ‘The Relation’ (as recognised by the World Association of News Publishers). Mass media developed exponentially with the rise of recording technology like the telephone and the creation of photography. During the 1900s, radio and television appeared. But what really changed the game was the advent of the internet and social media platforms in the 21st century. In every era, there were brave, brilliant, and clear-eyed journalists at work; journalists such as Joseph Pulitzer and Ramnath Goenka, who are known for their legacy of speaking truth to power even today.
Over the years, and especially in the last decade, there have been fascinating innovations in media, especially the way news is covered, written, edited, and reported. The type of content – features, editorials, podcasts, columns, videos, news – has diversified depending on the channel of information dissemination such as print, broadcast, and the internet media.
In terms of market share, global print media is expected to grow from $287.87 billion in 2020 to $313.28 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.8%. In India alone, daily newspapers reported a combined circulation of over 240 million copies as of 2018, making the country the second-largest newspaper market in the world.
India currently has over 400 news channels. In 2020, news viewership across languages jumped to an all-time high, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). A survey reveals that online sources, too, raked in significant numbers last year, with an increase in the payment of digital news. In several countries, online news overtook television as the most frequently used source of news. Brexit, Black Lives Matter, the US presidential elections, climate change emergency and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were the most covered issues worldwide.
People rely on truth-seeking journalism that is free from commercial and political influence. Everyone deserves to read accurate news and thoughtful perspectives on critical issues and events. As more and more become well-informed, they get inspired to take calculated decisions and meaningful action.
There is, therefore, a compelling need for quality journalism and media to sift through the noise of information overload and report the truth with a balanced analysis. A degree in MA Journalism and Mass Communication can open the doors for careers in several profiles including:
Digital Media Executive
Features Writer
Columnist
Content Developer
Sub-Editor
Proof-Reader
Editor
Screen Writer
Illustrator
Business Editor
Investigative Journalist
Photojournalist
UPES School of Modern Media
, Dehradun, prepares its students in various aspects of journalism and mass communication – from writing for media to developing communication skills to learning the basics of electronic and digital productions.

UPES School of Modern Media nurtures students to thrive in an ever-evolving media ecosystem. As India’s only digital-first media school, the school instills foundational skills and knowledge that position graduates to stay ahead in a world where media is interactive, immediate, and always on.

Year 1556. The government of Venice published a monthly written notice to convey information about politics, economics, and military matters throughout Europe. It was called the Notizie scritte, a term that eventually came to mean ‘newspaper’.
However, it was after the invention of the printing press that the world saw its first proper newspaper in the 1600s, ‘The Relation’ (as recognised by the World Association of News Publishers). Mass media developed exponentially with the rise of recording technology like the telephone and the creation of photography. During the 1900s, radio and television appeared. But what really changed the game was the advent of the internet and social media platforms in the 21st century. In every era, there were brave, brilliant, and clear-eyed journalists at work; journalists such as Joseph Pulitzer and Ramnath Goenka, who are known for their legacy of speaking truth to power even today.
Over the years, and especially in the last decade, there have been fascinating innovations in media, especially the way news is covered, written, edited, and reported. The type of content – features, editorials, podcasts, columns, videos, news – has diversified depending on the channel of information dissemination such as print, broadcast, and the internet media.
In terms of market share, global print media is expected to grow from $287.87 billion in 2020 to $313.28 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.8%. In India alone, daily newspapers reported a combined circulation of over 240 million copies as of 2018, making the country the second-largest newspaper market in the world.
India currently has over 400 news channels. In 2020, news viewership across languages jumped to an all-time high, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). A survey reveals that online sources, too, raked in significant numbers last year, with an increase in the payment of digital news. In several countries, online news overtook television as the most frequently used source of news. Brexit, Black Lives Matter, the US presidential elections, climate change emergency and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were the most covered issues worldwide.
People rely on truth-seeking journalism that is free from commercial and political influence. Everyone deserves to read accurate news and thoughtful perspectives on critical issues and events. As more and more become well-informed, they get inspired to take calculated decisions and meaningful action.
There is, therefore, a compelling need for quality journalism and media to sift through the noise of information overload and report the truth with a balanced analysis. A degree in MA Journalism and Mass Communication can open the doors for careers in several profiles including:
Digital Media Executive
Features Writer
Columnist
Content Developer
Sub-Editor

Investigative Journalist
