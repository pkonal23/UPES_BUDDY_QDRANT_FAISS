Program details
The Ph.D. program in Microbiology at UPES School of Health Science & Technology is designed to equip graduates with advanced skills in various aspects of applied scientific knowledge, with a specific focus on translational research. The department aims to contribute to the upgradation of the national healthcare system by integrating technological expertise in analytical and experimental methods with biological and medical sciences. The primary vision is to play a pivotal role in shaping a better clinical healthcare system, emphasizing excellence in teaching, research, and outreach.
The curriculum of the Ph.D. program covers a broad spectrum of topics within Microbiology and Immunology. Graduates are prepared to work as independent scientists, delving into disciplines such as microbial genomics and proteomics, host-pathogen relationships, T lymphocyte activation, drug discovery, combating antibiotic resistance, One Health, and the microbiome. Students engage in research exploring the habitats, ecology, and evolution of microorganisms, as well as investigating diseases caused by these microorganisms and the impact of the microbiome on immunity, disease, and human health.
The program's unique strengths lie in addressing contemporary challenges, such as antibiotic resistance, through the development of novel combination drug therapies, microbial engineering for environmental remediation, and understanding the effectiveness of the immune system against infectious diseases. The department actively collaborates with esteemed researchers worldwide and has established research partnerships, notably with the focus on Microbial Diversity in the North Himalayan Region for Infectious Disease and Epidemic Research. This collaboration provides students with state-of-the-art expertise in specific fields, bolstering their foundation in immunology and microbiology. The commitment to shaping a sustainable future for students and fostering intellectual growth underscores the department's dedication to being at the forefront of excellence in education and research in the field of Microbiology.
Program Highlights
The Ph.D. program in Microbiology at UPES School of Health Science & Technology offers a comprehensive curriculum integrating advanced studies in immunology and eukaryotic pathogenesis.
Emphasizing the latest advancements, the program utilizes state-of-the-art technologies in immunology, molecular biology, cell biology, and omics, providing students with hands-on experience in cutting-edge research methodologies.
The distinguished faculty members, with publications in high-impact international journals like Scientific Reports and Human Molecular Genetics, bring a wealth of expertise to guide and mentor students throughout their research journey.
The department's remarkable success is evidenced by securing research grants exceeding Rs. 1 crore from prestigious government funding bodies such as DST, FAPESP, and ICMR, underscoring its commitment to addressing global microbiological challenges.
Students benefit from an interdisciplinary approach, gaining insights into diverse aspects of microbiology through collaborations and exposure to a wide range of research projects.
With a focus on impactful research, the program cultivates a globally competitive environment, ensuring graduates are well-equipped to contribute significantly to the field of microbiology on an international scale.
PEO / PSO
The Ph.D. program in Microbiology at UPES School of Health Science & Technology is designed to cultivate highly skilled and innovative researchers who will contribute significantly to the field of microbiology.
