About the Conference
The rapid evolution of technology—driven by social media, artificial intelligence, and increasing global interconnectedness—has reshaped how individuals and societies communicate. While these advancements have unlocked new avenues for collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and innovation, they have also introduced critical challenges related to privacy, data security, misinformation, surveillance, and regulatory oversight.
Social media platforms have redefined interaction, empowering expression and commerce while raising concerns about misinformation, hate speech, and algorithmic bias. Legal systems worldwide continue to grapple with striking a balance between free speech and responsible regulation, as seen in landmark cases like
Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India (2015)
, which led to the striking down of Section 66A of the IT Act. Similarly, the growing emphasis on data privacy has positioned personal information as a key asset in the digital economy. The
Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs. Union of India (2017)
judgment recognized privacy as a fundamental right, influencing the enactment of India’s
Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
and aligning with global frameworks such as the EU’s GDPR.
While AI continues to drive transformation across industries, it also brings ethical and legal challenges, including biases in decision-making, workforce disruptions, and accountability gaps. Navigating these complexities requires a multidisciplinary approach considering the intersection of technology, law, and society.
This conference aims to bring together legal scholars, technologists, policymakers, and industry practitioners to critically examine these pressing issues. By fostering interdisciplinary discussions, it seeks to contribute to the evolving discourse on governance, ethics, and the responsible use of technology in the 21st century.
