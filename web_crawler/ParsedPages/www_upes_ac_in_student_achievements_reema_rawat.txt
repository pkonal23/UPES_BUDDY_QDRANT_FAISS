Reema Rawat - Achievement

Reema Rawat - Achievement

Reema Rawat, a PhD scholar in the Allied Health Sciences Department at the UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology, has been honoured with the Natco Pharma-Sponsored Dr. Yellapragada Subba Rao FABA Young Innovator Award 2024 at the University of Hyderabad. Along with the recognition, she received a cash prize of ₹5 lakh for her groundbreaking work on a portable cervical cancer screening device, a significant advancement in the accessibility and effectiveness of cancer diagnostics.
This accolade celebrates her pioneering efforts, marking a significant advancement in cancer diagnostics.
Reema began her research journey at UPES in 2022 under the guidance of Dr. Ashish Mathur.
About the Device:
This new tool can help find cervical cancer early, especially the kind caused by HPV-16, a key biomarker. Utilising an electrochemical biosensor, the device becomes more user-friendly, cost-effective and highly accessible making early detection possible so that the people in places with limited resources can get tested. In trials, this device worked well with clinical data and showcased a great potential to significantly lower cervical cancer mortality rates by facilitating early and non-invasive testing.
