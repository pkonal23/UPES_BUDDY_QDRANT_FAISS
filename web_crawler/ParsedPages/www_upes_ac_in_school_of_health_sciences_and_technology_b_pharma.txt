Program Details
An
undergraduate course in Pharmaceutical Sciences
offered by
UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology
also known as
B.Pharm.
is a four-year professional program divided into eight semesters that deals with the study of medicines. The core subjects of the
B.Pharm. course
include pharmaceutical chemistry (chemistry of medicinal compounds), pharmaceutics (manufacturing of dosage forms such as tablets, capsules etc.), pharmacology (action of drugs on the body and action of the body on the drugs) and pharmacognosy (medicinal drugs obtained from plants and other natural sources). A Bachelor's in B Pharm. undergraduate degree program focuses on the study of pharmacy, which entails the science of preparing, dispensing, and reviewing drugs and medications for safe and effective use.
In addition to imparting classroom teaching, students of
B.Pharm.
are provided with clinical and community exposure so that they become active change-makers and solution providers in the healthcare domain. On-the-job training through internships and clinical rotations in pharmacies and healthcare facilities are also imparted to B Pharm. students, thereby helping them become eligible for licensure exams to become registered pharmacists after successfully completing the programme. After completing a B.Pharm. programme, graduates can pursue careers as pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmaceutical researchers, among others.
Interestingly, the advancement of technology and the increasing use of artificial intelligence and big data in the pharmaceutical industry also lead to promising opportunities for pharmacy graduates to specialize in areas such as pharmacoinformatics, pharmacovigilance, and clinical research among others.
B.Pharm.
is a promising field that offers a wide range of career opportunities and has a broad outlook and scope. Graduates holding a
B.Pharm.
degree can pursue numerous career paths and profoundly contribute to the healthcare industry per se.
Program Highlights
Students enrolled in
B.Pharm. at UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology
are provided with world-class infrastructure and labs with a research-focused approach.
Student Exchange opportunities are also offered with Taipei Medical University (Taiwan), Providence University (Taiwan), and Airlangga University (Indonesia), which include student and faculty exchange, participation in research projects, seminars, conferences, and internship programmes.
Courses in
B.Pharm.
are co-developed and co-delivered by industry partners.
School of Health Sciences
and Technology has collaborated with Merck, AIIMS Rishikesh and many more such institutions.
Guidance and counselling for application to various international scholarship opportunities are also provided to the students of
B. Pharm
.
Student and faculty exchange, and participation in research projects, seminars, conferences, and internship programmes are also encouraged.
Future Scope / Industry Trends
The scope of
B.Pharm.
is ever-increasing and will continue to expand in the future. With the increasing number of diseases, the need for medicines and pharmaceuticals is also increasing, which is leading to an increase in the demand for pharmacists.
B.Pharm.
graduates can look forward to a bright career in the fields of research and development, clinical trials, medical writing, drug safety, regulatory affairs, sales and marketing, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. In addition, they can also pursue higher studies in the field like M. Pharm. and Ph.D. in Pharmacy.
B.Pharm.
graduates can also explore other fields, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and biomedical engineering. With the advancement of technology and the increasing demand for medicines and pharmaceuticals, the scope of
B.Pharm.
is only expected to grow in the future.

Program Details
An
undergraduate course in Pharmaceutical Sciences
offered by
UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology
also known as
B.Pharm.
is a four-year professional program divided into eight semesters that deals with the study of medicines. The core subjects of the
B.Pharm. course
include pharmaceutical chemistry (chemistry of medicinal compounds), pharmaceutics (manufacturing of dosage forms such as tablets, capsules etc.), pharmacology (action of drugs on the body and action of the body on the drugs) and pharmacognosy (medicinal drugs obtained from plants and other natural sources). A Bachelor's in B Pharm. undergraduate degree program focuses on the study of pharmacy, which entails the science of preparing, dispensing, and reviewing drugs and medications for safe and effective use.
In addition to imparting classroom teaching, students of
B.Pharm.
are provided with clinical and community exposure so that they become active change-makers and solution providers in the healthcare domain. On-the-job training through internships and clinical rotations in pharmacies and healthcare facilities are also imparted to B Pharm. students, thereby helping them become eligible for licensure exams to become registered pharmacists after successfully completing the programme. After completing a B.Pharm. programme, graduates can pursue careers as pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmaceutical researchers, among others.
Interestingly, the advancement of technology and the increasing use of artificial intelligence and big data in the pharmaceutical industry also lead to promising opportunities for pharmacy graduates to specialize in areas such as pharmacoinformatics, pharmacovigilance, and clinical research among others.

Program Details
An
undergraduate course in Pharmaceutical Sciences
offered by
UPES School of Health Sciences and Technology
also known as
B.Pharm.
is a four-year professional program divided into eight semesters that deals with the study of medicines. The core subjects of the
B.Pharm. course
include pharmaceutical chemistry (chemistry of medicinal compounds), pharmaceutics (manufacturing of dosage forms such as tablets, capsules etc.), pharmacology (action of drugs on the body and action of the body on the drugs) and pharmacognosy (medicinal drugs obtained from plants and other natural sources). A Bachelor's in B Pharm. undergraduate degree program focuses on the study of pharmacy, which entails the science of preparing, dispensing, and reviewing drugs and medications for safe and effective use.
In addition to imparting classroom teaching, students of
B.Pharm.
are provided with clinical and community exposure so that they become active change-makers and solution providers in the healthcare domain. On-the-job training through internships and clinical rotations in pharmacies and healthcare facilities are also imparted to B Pharm. students, thereby helping them become eligible for licensure exams to become registered pharmacists after successfully completing the programme. After completing a B.Pharm. programme, graduates can pursue careers as pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmaceutical researchers, among others.
Interestingly, the advancement of technology and the increasing use of artificial intelligence and big data in the pharmaceutical industry also lead to promising opportunities for pharmacy graduates to specialize in areas such as pharmacoinformatics, pharmacovigilance, and clinical research among others.
B.Pharm.
is a promising field that offers a wide range of career opportunities and has a broad outlook and scope. Graduates holding a
