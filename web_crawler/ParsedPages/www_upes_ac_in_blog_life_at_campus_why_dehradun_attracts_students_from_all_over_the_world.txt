Why Dehradun attracts students from all over the world
Ekta Kashyap
Published 02/06/2021
The city has a rich history, old-world charm, and stunning natural landscapes, in perfect harmony with the efficiency and convenience of urban infrastructure. Dehradun is not only the most forested capitals among the Indian states, but it is also home to several reputed institutions of higher learning
It was during his early twenties when Ruskin Bond decided to live at a quaint hilly haven in India and become a writer. He found his bliss in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Since then, the majestic mountains, crisp air, lush greenery, tall oak and pine trees of the Himalayas became the backdrop of his books.
The celebrated author is not the only icon whose success has been influenced by this land. Luminaries such as Late Rajiv Gandhi, the sixth (and the youngest) Prime Minister of India; Abhinav Bindra, the nation’s first individual Olympic gold medallist; and Amitav Ghosh, winner of ‘Jnanpith’ – India’s highest literary honour – received their education from some of the revered institutions of Uttarakhand, more specifically its capital Dehradun.
The city has a rich history, old-world charm, and stunning natural landscapes, in perfect harmony with the efficiency and convenience of urban infrastructure. Dehradun is not only the most forested capitals among the Indian states, but it is also home to several reputed institutions of higher learning. A survey by the Higher Education Department of Uttarakhand Government indicates that the city saw a threefold increase in the number of management and engineering colleges within eight years. Endowed with labels such as the ‘Eton of the East’ and ‘The School Capital of India’, Dehradun prides itself on its educational institutions.
Located 2200 feet above sea level, Dehradun has a moderate temperature throughout the year. Being close to the hills, it also offers several options for exhilarating road trips and weekend getaways. Former Surveyor General of India Sir George Everest’s House (known for having Mount Everest, the highest mountain on earth, named in his honour), Mindrolling Monastery, Kempty Falls, Robber’s Cave, Forest Research Institute (a heritage building with Greco-Roman architecture), Kalinga War Memorial, and Rajaji National Park are among the popular attractions of the city.
Dehradun is a delight for nature as well as adventure lovers. One can get associated with several NGOs to work for biodiversity as well as explore thrilling activities including paragliding, river rafting, bungee jumping, swimming, and ice skating. Besides, there are several engineering marvels such as dams, canals, waterways, and power plants for those wanting to combine knowledge with fun. The city’s rejuvenating atmosphere makes it an ideal harbour for students who want to develop life skills and gain an unparalleled learning experience.

How UPES nurtures students for professional and personal success
Among the several academic institutions in Dehradun, UPES has risen as a university that encourages learning beyond the classroom. Here students discover that there are several facets to the campus.
UPES has seven student clubs and more than 22 student chapters, such as the Infinity Aerospace Club, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Computer Society of India, and more. The university also organises cultural events such as ‘Uurja’, which is celebrated for two days at the campus. ‘Wow Wednesday’ is a mid-week activity planned to break the monotonous routine by providing students with a platform to showcase their talent and acknowledge their peers as well.
Nestled in the serenity of the mountains, UPES provides a pollution-free environment that helps in stimulating students’ mind and improves their overall health.  The establishment also emphasises on physical fitness; students are encouraged to participate and excel in a variety of sports that are organised regularly in the university. Further, students are empowered to engage in constructive social action, develop cooperative team spirit, and gain skills such as leadership quality.
Caring for the environment and people around is fundamental to all activities at UPES. The university has adopted many schools in villages and suburbs area around to impart primary and higher education and computer literacy. UPES believes when you care enough, you can change the world.
UPES offers world-class academic infrastructure, multimedia-enabled classrooms, modern research labs, and other facilities for curricular and extracurricular activities to its students
These activities aid in the holistic development of students and lead to a fulfilling academic experience.
At its sprawling 44-acre campus, UPES offers world-class academic infrastructure, multimedia-enabled classrooms, modern research labs, a large expanse of sports fields, food courts, and other facilities for curricular and extracurricular activities to its students. UPES provides in-campus hostels for international students at affordable prices.
Study in India – made easier
To facilitate admissions for international students into UPES, the university has participated in the Study In India (SII) initiative of Educational Consultants India Ltd (EdCIL), Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.
The SII initiative has designed a framework to award scholarships and tuition fee waivers for meritorious students applying to the program. It offers SII scholarships on an annual basis, while its partner institutes, like UPES, provide tuition fee waivers.
The SII scholarship scheme covers the admission fees, tuition fees, accommodation (room and boarding) costs, and food costs. Under this scheme, more than 30,000 tuition fee waivers are given to deserving students by partner institutes, like UPES, in the ranges of 100%, 50%, and 25%.

Why Dehradun attracts students from all over the world

The city has a rich history, old-world charm, and stunning natural landscapes, in perfect harmony with the efficiency and convenience of urban infrastructure. Dehradun is not only the most forested capitals among the Indian states, but it is also home to several reputed institutions of higher learning
It was during his early twenties when Ruskin Bond decided to live at a quaint hilly haven in India and become a writer. He found his bliss in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Since then, the majestic mountains, crisp air, lush greenery, tall oak and pine trees of the Himalayas became the backdrop of his books.
The celebrated author is not the only icon whose success has been influenced by this land. Luminaries such as Late Rajiv Gandhi, the sixth (and the youngest) Prime Minister of India; Abhinav Bindra, the nation’s first individual Olympic gold medallist; and Amitav Ghosh, winner of ‘Jnanpith’ – India’s highest literary honour – received their education from some of the revered institutions of Uttarakhand, more specifically its capital Dehradun.
The city has a rich history, old-world charm, and stunning natural landscapes, in perfect harmony with the efficiency and convenience of urban infrastructure. Dehradun is not only the most forested capitals among the Indian states, but it is also home to several reputed institutions of higher learning. A survey by the Higher Education Department of Uttarakhand Government indicates that the city saw a threefold increase in the number of management and engineering colleges within eight years. Endowed with labels such as the ‘Eton of the East’ and ‘The School Capital of India’, Dehradun prides itself on its educational institutions.
Located 2200 feet above sea level, Dehradun has a moderate temperature throughout the year. Being close to the hills, it also offers several options for exhilarating road trips and weekend getaways. Former Surveyor General of India Sir George Everest’s House (known for having Mount Everest, the highest mountain on earth, named in his honour), Mindrolling Monastery, Kempty Falls, Robber’s Cave, Forest Research Institute (a heritage building with Greco-Roman architecture), Kalinga War Memorial, and Rajaji National Park are among the popular attractions of the city.
Dehradun is a delight for nature as well as adventure lovers. One can get associated with several NGOs to work for biodiversity as well as explore thrilling activities including paragliding, river rafting, bungee jumping, swimming, and ice skating. Besides, there are several engineering marvels such as dams, canals, waterways, and power plants for those wanting to combine knowledge with fun. The city’s rejuvenating atmosphere makes it an ideal harbour for students who want to develop life skills and gain an unparalleled learning experience.

How UPES nurtures students for professional and personal success
Among the several academic institutions in Dehradun, UPES has risen as a university that encourages learning beyond the classroom. Here students discover that there are several facets to the campus.
