Dr. Utsab Debnath

Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Debnath received postdoctoral experience in medicinal chemistry from Bose Institute, Kolkata, India. Before that, he received a Ph.D. in pharmaceutical chemistry from CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow (Degree conferred by Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Lucknow, India). Dr. Debnath completed his bachelor's in pharmacy and masters in pharmaceutical chemistry from West Bengal University of Technology, India.
Work Experience
Research experience is more than 13 years, and teaching experience is more than six years.
Research Interests
Research interest in design, synthesis, biological studies, and structure-activity relationship studies (SAR) of anti-infective (HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2, Malaria) and anti-cancer agents.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Debnath was awarded the ‘National Postdoctoral Fellowship’ under the ‘DST-Young Scientist Scheme’ of Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), New Delhi in 2017 for two years to perform research work in cancer. He was also awarded ‘Direct Senior Research Fellowship’ from Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) New Delhi in 2011 for a period of four years to carry Ph.D. research on HIV-1. He has qualified GPAT conducted by AICTE. He has completed an extramural research project as principal investigator.
Scholarly Activities

Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Debnath believes that current teaching methods need to be modified to produce effective learners and make the learning process more significant. He uses the “Constructivism framework” policy to improve active learning rather than spoon-feeding with information. He prefers to use PowerPoint presentations and good-quality audio-video materials to make the topic of discussion more attractive to students. Also, he favors giving problems to the students to determine through proper group discussion and, afterward, providing study materials and taking regular class tests to assess their level of understanding.
Courses Taught
Taking bachelor and master classes (B.Pharm & MSc) for the subjects related to pharmaceutical inorganic chemistry, pharmaceutical organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and drug design and development.

Research experience is more than 13 years, and teaching experience is more than six years.
Research Interests
Research interest in design, synthesis, biological studies, and structure-activity relationship studies (SAR) of anti-infective (HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2, Malaria) and anti-cancer agents.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Debnath was awarded the ‘National Postdoctoral Fellowship’ under the ‘DST-Young Scientist Scheme’ of Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), New Delhi in 2017 for two years to perform research work in cancer. He was also awarded ‘Direct Senior Research Fellowship’ from Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) New Delhi in 2011 for a period of four years to carry Ph.D. research on HIV-1. He has qualified GPAT conducted by AICTE. He has completed an extramural research project as principal investigator.

Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Debnath believes that current teaching methods need to be modified to produce effective learners and make the learning process more significant. He uses the “Constructivism framework” policy to improve active learning rather than spoon-feeding with information. He prefers to use PowerPoint presentations and good-quality audio-video materials to make the topic of discussion more attractive to students. Also, he favors giving problems to the students to determine through proper group discussion and, afterward, providing study materials and taking regular class tests to assess their level of understanding.
Courses Taught
Taking bachelor and master classes (B.Pharm & MSc) for the subjects related to pharmaceutical inorganic chemistry, pharmaceutical organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and drug design and development.
