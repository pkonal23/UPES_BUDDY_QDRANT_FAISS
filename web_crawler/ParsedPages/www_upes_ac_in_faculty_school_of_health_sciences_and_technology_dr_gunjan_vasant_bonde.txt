Dr. Gunjan Vasant Bonde

Assistant Professor (Selection Grade)

Profile Summary
After earning B. Pharm. from the University of Mumbai and an M. Pharm. in Pharmaceutics with Distinction from the University of Pune, Dr. Gunjan completed his Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology - Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU) Varanasi. He was affiliated to ‘Teaching Assistanceship’ in the above-said institute. His Ph.D. work was focused on designing and developing nano-drug delivery for the effective treatment of breast cancer. On the other hand, he is experienced in developing nanoparticles and nanofibers to deliver drugs effectively. Currently, he works as an Assistant Professor - Senior Scale at the School of Health Sciences and Technology, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, Uttarakhand (India). To his credit, he has 18 publications and four book chapters and participated in various poster and oral presentations.
Work Experience
He has 3.5 years of teaching and nine years of research experience. Also, he worked as Trainee (Pharmaceutical R & D) at Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., Goregaon, Mumbai (India), as well as a Project trainee at the National AIDS Research Institute (Indian Council of Medical Research, Govt. of India).
Research Interests
Dr. Gunjan carries expertise in the areas of pharmaceutical product development, design, and development of novel drug delivery systems like micelle, nanoparticles, nanofibres, and other nano colloidal drug delivery systems, rate-controlled and targeted approaches for cancer chemotherapy, enhancement of drug solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble drug, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution.
Teaching Philosophy
Teaching is a very prestigious and responsible profession, and a teacher is a responsible path director for the proper guidance to the students who have faith in the teacher and building the nation indirectly. Being a teacher, I could be a link between knowledge and student and make students learn quickly through my guidance, proper explanation, and demonstration by audio-visual aids and performance in the laboratories. At the same time, the teacher must be a good learner, as learning is a lifelong process. He believes one of the most precious and invaluable feelings is to hear that students achieve their goals successfully and that teachers contribute a little behind the curtains. Authenticity is essential for him as a teacher. He considers being true to himself in every aspect essential, so he also ensures that every bit of information given to students is true to his best knowledge. Sincerity, honesty, hard work, ethical practice, and faithfulness to my teaching profession will be the “Mantras” he does believe in and follow for my teaching professional career.
Courses Taught
Pharmaceutics, Biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics, Physical Pharmaceutics, Pharmaceutical engineering, Industrial Pharmacy, Cosmetic sciences, Global Regulations in Clinical trials, etc.
Awards and Grants
He qualified for GPAT in 2010. He is a recipient of the prestigious “Bharat Shiksha Gaurav Puraskar-2023” by KTK Outstanding Achievers and Education Foundation, New Delhi (International); “SPER Best Student (Ph. D) Award, 2020”, Gwalior, India; “Best Scholar” Award by ScienceFather, Scifax Company Group, Chennai India; International Travel Grant by DBT-CTEP, New Delhi and IIT (BHU), Varanasi (2019); Teaching Assistantship by IIT (BHU), Varanasi and MHRD, New Delhi (2014-19); Fellowship by UGC, New Delhi (2010-12). “Sir Ratan Tata Scholarship” (2006-07), “Maharashtra State Scholarship” (1998-2003), and “Maharashtra Talent Search Scholarship” (2001-2003).
He has received an Extra-mural/Industry Grant (Oil India Limited) in 2022 (16.1 Lakhs) and Seed Grant (UPES) in 2021 (5 Lakhs).
Scholarly Activities
He has an h-index and i-10 index of 13 with 520 citations. Recent publications are as follows.

Pharm. in Pharmaceutics with Distinction from the University of Pune, Dr. Gunjan completed his Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology - Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU) Varanasi. He was affiliated to ‘Teaching Assistanceship’ in the above-said institute. His Ph.D. work was focused on designing and developing nano-drug delivery for the effective treatment of breast cancer. On the other hand, he is experienced in developing nanoparticles and nanofibers to deliver drugs effectively. Currently, he works as an Assistant Professor - Senior Scale at the School of Health Sciences and Technology, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, Uttarakhand (India). To his credit, he has 18 publications and four book chapters and participated in various poster and oral presentations.
Work Experience
He has 3.5 years of teaching and nine years of research experience. Also, he worked as Trainee (Pharmaceutical R & D) at Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., Goregaon, Mumbai (India), as well as a Project trainee at the National AIDS Research Institute (Indian Council of Medical Research, Govt. of India).
Research Interests
Dr. Gunjan carries expertise in the areas of pharmaceutical product development, design, and development of novel drug delivery systems like micelle, nanoparticles, nanofibres, and other nano colloidal drug delivery systems, rate-controlled and targeted approaches for cancer chemotherapy, enhancement of drug solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble drug, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution.
Teaching Philosophy
Teaching is a very prestigious and responsible profession, and a teacher is a responsible path director for the proper guidance to the students who have faith in the teacher and building the nation indirectly. Being a teacher, I could be a link between knowledge and student and make students learn quickly through my guidance, proper explanation, and demonstration by audio-visual aids and performance in the laboratories. At the same time, the teacher must be a good learner, as learning is a lifelong process. He believes one of the most precious and invaluable feelings is to hear that students achieve their goals successfully and that teachers contribute a little behind the curtains. Authenticity is essential for him as a teacher. He considers being true to himself in every aspect essential, so he also ensures that every bit of information given to students is true to his best knowledge. Sincerity, honesty, hard work, ethical practice, and faithfulness to my teaching profession will be the “Mantras” he does believe in and follow for my teaching professional career.
Courses Taught
Pharmaceutics, Biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics, Physical Pharmaceutics, Pharmaceutical engineering, Industrial Pharmacy, Cosmetic sciences, Global Regulations in Clinical trials, etc.

He believes one of the most precious and invaluable feelings is to hear that students achieve their goals successfully and that teachers contribute a little behind the curtains. Authenticity is essential for him as a teacher. He considers being true to himself in every aspect essential, so he also ensures that every bit of information given to students is true to his best knowledge. Sincerity, honesty, hard work, ethical practice, and faithfulness to my teaching profession will be the “Mantras” he does believe in and follow for my teaching professional career.
