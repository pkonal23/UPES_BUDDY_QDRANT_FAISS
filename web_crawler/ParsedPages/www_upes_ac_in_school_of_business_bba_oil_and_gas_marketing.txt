Program Details
UPES's
BBA in Oil & Gas Management
is a flagship course designed to produce well-rounded managers with a specialized focus on the oil and gas industry. The program aims to equip students with comprehensive knowledge of the industry, combining general management education with domain-tailored subjects. Students will be exposed to various aspects of the oil and gas sector, such as natural gas business, petroleum exploration, refining, petrochemical business, refinery management, business analysis, financial management, and marketing research, all taught by experienced instructors from around the world.
One of the unique features of the program is its integration of curricular activities and industry connections. As a member of the Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry, UPES provides opportunities for students to join the student chapter, allowing them to practically apply their managerial skills and build valuable connections within the industry. The university's focus on digitalization and IT skills also ensures that students are prepared for the changing landscape of the oil and gas industry.
The
BBA in Oil & Gas Management
offers two specializations: Petroleum Business and Oil & Gas Operations. The Petroleum Business specialization concentrates on retail marketing of petroleum products, focusing on product brands and consumer behavior. On the other hand, the Oil & Gas Operations specialization emphasizes efficient management of oil and gas resources, covering various areas such as NG and LNG production, City Gas Distribution, financing projects, conservation, and policy. Additionally, students will learn about data-driven decision-making, including data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning, and data visualization. Overall, this program equips students with the necessary skills, knowledge, and confidence to excel in the oil and gas industry. It prepares them to become adaptable and agile managers who can meet the challenges and demands of the global market. With India's move towards a "Gas Based Economy" and the increasing importance of digitalization, this program offers ample opportunities for students to secure rewarding careers in various sectors of the oil and gas industry.
Program Highlights
Students undertake major projects and live internships with companies, providing hands-on experience in the oil & gas industry.
The
BBA in Oil & Gas Management
program offers diverse career options, enabling students to pursue either operations and consulting in the oil & gas sector or opt for higher education.
Emphasis on research projects, seminars, conferences, and internships encourages students to develop a deeper understanding of the industry.
Real-world case studies, industry visits, and guest lectures from experts expose students to the practical aspects of the oil & gas domain.
UPES School of Business offers modern smart classrooms, a well-equipped Analytics Lab, a comprehensive library, and advanced analytical tools for an enriched learning environment.
