Dr. G. Gopalakrishnan

Senior Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. G. Gopalakrishnan is an accomplished academician with a career spanning over 26 years in India and abroad. He specializes in heterogeneous catalysis and has conducted extensive research both in industry and academia. Over the years, he has been actively involved in teaching a variety of courses to undergraduate, postgraduate, and Ph.D. scholars. Dr. Gopalakrishnan has successfully mentored over 100 students in their projects and dissertations, many of whom have gone on to secure admission to Ph.D. programs, both in India and abroad. As a principal investigator, he has successfully completed two funded research projects worth 1.49 crores. Additionally, he has published 14 papers in journals indexed by WoS and Scopus and presented 15 papers at various international and national conferences.
Work Experience
After completing his Ph.D. in 1995 from Anna University, Dr. Gopalakrishnan worked for 2 years in the Research & Development Division of Thirumalai Chemicals Limited, one of the world's largest producers of phthalic anhydride. Following that, he served as a lecturer at Easwari Engineering College, part of the SRM group, for 5 years. Subsequently, he spent 3 years as an Assistant Professor at KCG College of Technology in Chennai, India. After gaining valuable experience abroad, he worked as an Associate Professor for 7 years at the University of Gondar in Ethiopia, where he played a pivotal role in developing curricula for a postgraduate program in Polymer Science. After returning to India, he served as an Associate Professor at B.S. Abdur Rahman University, Chennai, for 1 year before joining UPES in August 2012. He currently holds the position of Senior Associate Professor at UPES.
Research Interests
Dr. Gopalakrishnan's core research area lies in heterogeneous catalysis. His work primarily involves the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of catalysts for diverse applications such as petroleum refining, petrochemicals, biomass conversion to fuels and value-added chemicals, and energy carrier applications.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Gopalakrishnan's teaching philosophy is centred on cultivating enthusiasm for the subject matter by underscoring its direct relevance to diverse industries and its potential impact on student's future careers within their chosen fields of study. He firmly believes that igniting interest not only enhances their academic experience but also equips them with practical skills and insights that are directly transferable to the professional realm. To achieve this, Dr. Gopalakrishnan employs a multifaceted approach that merges theoretical knowledge with real-world applications. He consistently demonstrates how the concepts covered in the curriculum have practical implications in industries, making the subject matter more engaging and tangible for students. This strategy empowers students to envision how the knowledge they acquire can be directly applied in real-world scenarios, fostering a deeper understanding and motivation to learn.
Courses Taught
He has taught a wide range of courses to undergraduate and postgraduate students, including Thermodynamics, Petroleum Refining, Petrochemical Technology, Catalysis and Catalytic Materials, Polymer Science and Engineering, Process Chemistry, and Industrial Chemistry. Additionally, he conducts a specialized course on Research and Publication Ethics for Ph.D. scholars.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Gopalakrishnan received Senior Research Fellow from CSIR, New Delhi and an MRL research fellowship from Madras Refineries Limited in 1991. Additionally, he also received a grant from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India for his project ‘Direct conversion of Sugarcane Bagasse to auto fuels by Catalytic hydrous pyrolysis in the presence of carbon monoxide’. He received another prestigious grant from Indian Oil Corporation Limited (R&D) for his project ‘Development of Catalysts for Isomerization & Dimerisation of light alkanes’.
Scholarly Activities
Apart from being the recipient of esteemed grants and fellowships from organizations including CSIR, MRL, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, and Indian Oil Corporation Limited, among others, Dr. Gopalakrishnan has been deeply involved in scholarly pursuits spanning chemical sciences and energy-related domains. He participated in seminars and conferences such as the National Seminar on recent advances in chemical sciences and the International Conference on Energy, Environment, and Industrial Safety (ICEEIS). He has also played roles in conferences like chairing sessions for events including the International Conference on Energy Sustainability and Advanced Materials (ICESAM-2022), the International Conference on Materials for Energy Storage and Conservation (MESC 2022), and the 3rd Biennial Oil, Gas, and Petrochemical Conference (OGPC2020). His involvement also extends to events like the International Conference on Advances in Chemical Engineering (AdChE-2020) and the 24th National Conference on I.C. Engines and Combustion.
