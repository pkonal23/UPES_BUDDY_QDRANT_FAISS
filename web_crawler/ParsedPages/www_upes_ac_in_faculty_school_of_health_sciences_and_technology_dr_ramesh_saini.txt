Profile Summary
Dr. Saini earned his Ph.D. in Biotechnology from the CSIR-CFTRI, University of Mysore, Mysore, India, and M.Sc. in Agriculture with a specialization in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology from GBPU&T, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, India. Dr. Saini has worked as an Associate Professor (Research) at the Department of Crop Science, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea, for nine fascinating years. Dr. Saini has an excellent track record of 85 articles in 36 journals of international reputation, with an accumulative impact factor of 465.1 (SCI IF 2022), h-index of 36, and 6300+ citations. Based on these huge citations, Dr. Saini is listed amongst the world's top 2% of scientists in a report published by Stanford University researchers. Dr. Saini's current research interests include the development and validation of analytical methods for the identification and quantification of nutraceuticals in food, investigating the factors affecting the bioavailability and bioactivity of dietary minerals and vitamins in animal models, and development of novel food processing to preserve the nutritional value of industrial crops and products.
Work Experience
Dr. Saini has conducted comprehensive investigations into the extraction and analysis of phytochemicals, unveiling their profound contributions to human health and well-being. Incredibly, his research career revolves around meticulously characterizing lipophilic dietary components, encompassing carotenoids, tocopherols, phytosterols, and omega-3 fatty acids. His pioneering work has extended to the comprehensive analysis of numerous herbs, fruits, vegetables, and seafood. In addition,
Dr. Saini has investigated the cellular and molecular events involved in the chemopreventive activities of β-cryptoxanthin isolated from citrus fruits and lutein from marigold petals.
Research Interests
Dr. Saini is a plant Biotechnologist. His primary research interests include 1) simplified extraction of nutraceuticals, especially carotenoids; 2) development and validation of analytical methods for the identification and quantification of nutraceuticals in food; 3) development of novel food processing to preserve the nutritional value of industrial crops and products; 4) valorization of agro-industrial wastes towards the production of nutritionally import metabolites, and 5) cytotoxic and antiproliferative potential of natural carotenoids against various cancer cells.
Dr. Saini enjoys developing simplified extraction and analytical methods for quantifying nutraceuticals, especially carotenoids, tocopherols, phytosterols, and omega-3 fatty acids, in crucial food sources, advancing our understanding of their nutritional profiles. Dr. Saini has developed an efficient one-step scheme for purifying major xanthophyll carotenoids from lettuce.
Dr. Saini's Ph.D. research showcased Moringa's transformative potential in alleviating malnutrition, opening new avenues for sustainable nutrition solutions.
Awards and Grants
Dr. Saini is listed amongst the world's top 2% of scientists in a report published by Stanford University researchers in 2023, with an impressive composite score of 41,836.

Dr. Saini has received Postdoctoral Research fellowship from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India, New Delhi, from January 2014 to July 2014.
Dr. Saini has successfully completed an externally funded project (2019-2022) entitled "Value-addition of shrimp processing waste via efficient recovery of commercially vital carotenoid astaxanthin, and its microencapsulation for enhanced physical and biological activities" funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), Korea government (MSIT) (Grant No. 2019R1G1A1006815), with a total grant of 90 million KRW (55 Lakh INR).
Dr. Saini is serving as an Associate Editor of
Frontiers in Nutrition
(IF-5.0) and an editorial board member of
Foods
(IF- 5.2).
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Saini is a dedicated advocate for global sustainability, leading initiatives to transform agro-industrial and household food processing waste into economically significant resources. His visionary work secured a substantial $67,000 grant from the esteemed National Research Foundation of Korea. This funding supported a pioneering project to extract astaxanthin, a pivotal carotenoid, from shrimp processing waste and enhance its properties through microencapsulation techniques.
In addition to his impactful sustainability efforts, Dr. Saini's editorial influence is equally profound. He assumes the role of Associate Editor for 'Frontiers in Nutrition' and holds a position on the editorial board of 'Foods.' In this capacity, he has contributed to the advancement of scientific knowledge by conducting rigorous reviews of numerous scholarly articles, thus ensuring the publication of high-quality research and upholding the highest peer review standards within the domains of nutrition and food science while providing invaluable support to fellow researchers.

Scholarly Activities

Scholarly Activities

Dr. Saini is a dedicated advocate for global sustainability, leading initiatives to transform agro-industrial and household food processing waste into economically significant resources. His visionary work secured a substantial $67,000 grant from the esteemed National Research Foundation of Korea. This funding supported a pioneering project to extract astaxanthin, a pivotal carotenoid, from shrimp processing waste and enhance its properties through microencapsulation techniques.
In addition to his impactful sustainability efforts, Dr. Saini's editorial influence is equally profound. He assumes the role of Associate Editor for 'Frontiers in Nutrition' and holds a position on the editorial board of 'Foods.' In this capacity, he has contributed to the advancement of scientific knowledge by conducting rigorous reviews of numerous scholarly articles, thus ensuring the publication of high-quality research and upholding the highest peer review standards within the domains of nutrition and food science while providing invaluable support to fellow researchers.

Dr. Saini is a dedicated advocate for global sustainability, leading initiatives to transform agro-industrial and household food processing waste into economically significant resources. His visionary work secured a substantial $67,000 grant from the esteemed National Research Foundation of Korea. This funding supported a pioneering project to extract astaxanthin, a pivotal carotenoid, from shrimp processing waste and enhance its properties through microencapsulation techniques.

In addition to his impactful sustainability efforts, Dr. Saini's editorial influence is equally profound. He assumes the role of Associate Editor for 'Frontiers in Nutrition' and holds a position on the editorial board of 'Foods.' In this capacity, he has contributed to the advancement of scientific knowledge by conducting rigorous reviews of numerous scholarly articles, thus ensuring the publication of high-quality research and upholding the highest peer review standards within the domains of nutrition and food science while providing invaluable support to fellow researchers.
