Program Details
The globally recognisable programme in Political Science provides students with a conceptual and empirical grounding in Political Science and Public Policy. The programme engages with case studies and field-based research to promote a deeper understanding of our surroundings. This transdisciplinary program teaches students to understand the complementarities and interconnections between allied social science disciplines and sub-fields of Political Science such as contemporary Indian politics, Comparative Politics, Political Economy, Climate, and International relations. The complexities of real-world challenges and the interconnectedness of socio-political and economic issues necessitate an interdisciplinary approach.
Our internationally recognised faculty deploys contemporary methodologies to prepare students to think critically about the causalities and processes and understand real-world problems to provide solutions. This comprehensive programme prepares students for higher studies and jobs in the industry. This program will hold students in good stead for higher education and relevant career options.
While maintaining the disciplinary focus, the cornerstone of this undergraduate degree is Transdisciplinarity. The courses are located at the unique intersectionality of various disciplines and issues. Learning from multi-disciplinary perspectives gives students a vast horizon, enabling them to make broad connections.    For example, one of the biggest contemporary challenges of climate change can be approached from scientific, economic, historical and sociological viewpoints.
Complimenting the classroom teachings are our Masterclasses, where academics and practitioners are invited to engage with the students on a range of contemporary issues.  This harmonious synergy of academics and practitioners provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the contemporary challenges, encouraging students to think beyond the disciplinary boundaries. These aspects are included organically in our unique curriculums designed by globally renowned faculty.
Our experiential pedagogy through connecting with the neighborhood takes students outside the classroom to face and tackle vexing political-economic-social and policy problems. Guided by our faculty, students are expected to work on live locations to think creatively about social justice, identify problems, provide creative solutions, and connect to real-world issues in this rapidly changing world. Besides, we have a structured fellowship and internship track should students want to delve deeper into specific issues preparing them for the pragmatic application of concepts learnt in the class to the real world.
We firmly believe no undergraduate degree is complete without experiencing the world outside one’s locale. In this light, the program offers ample exchange opportunities with universities in Europe, Asia and North America. Likewise, we also receive exchange students from similar programs worldwide, making our students a part of global classrooms.
All this under the meticulous guidance of our globally trained faculty, some of whom hold PhDs from the world’s top ten universities (QS ranking).
Program Highlights
BA in Political Science is an empirically driven program emphasizing field-based learning. We train students to conduct original enquiry and enable them to make broad causal connections over time.
Students receive individual guidance from the globally renowned faculty to prepare them to make applications for the top 250 universities globally.
The program allows students to explore exchange semesters with legacy varsities in Europe, Asia, and North America. Additionally, the program prepares students to be problem solvers-quality that is much sought after in industry-specific roles.
Going beyond classroom teaching, the program offers praxis-based fellowship opportunities to students. As part of this module, students will be placed as fellows to work with Members of Parliament, Think Tanks, NGOs, Embassies, and International Organizations.
The program trains students to sharpen their research arguments and helps prepare them for group discussions and interviews in academia and industry, enhancing their overall employability.
Future Scope / Industry Trends
A BA in Political Science program offers students a comprehensive understanding of core theories and concepts in Political Science and Public Policy. Students can connect theoretical concepts with real-world empirical material through this program and apply their knowledge practically. The curriculum covers various subjects, including Indian politics, democratic institutions, citizenship, gender issues, contemporary social, political, economic, and policy matters in India, as well as international relations, climate, and sustainability. Graduates of this program possess a comparative orientation that enables them to address socio-political and economic challenges and propose innovative solutions effectively. They acquire the skills to identify complex policy and governance issues, analyze causal relationships, and think creatively to solve policy puzzles. Overall, a BA (H) in Political Science equips students with a strong foundation in political analysis and prepares them for various career paths in politics, public administration, policy-making, research, and other related fields.
Career Opportunities
A BA in Political Science offers diverse career opportunities in various sectors. Students gain practical experience and problem-solving skills that make them suitable for roles in the private sector, industry, policy-based government, and non-governmental think tanks. Students can pursue MA/PhD positions in internationally renowned institutions with faculty guidance and hands-on training. In India, Political Science holds significant importance for public and administrative services, making this program at SoLS an excellent choice for those aiming for a civil services career.

Program Details
The globally recognisable programme in Political Science provides students with a conceptual and empirical grounding in Political Science and Public Policy. The programme engages with case studies and field-based research to promote a deeper understanding of our surroundings. This transdisciplinary program teaches students to understand the complementarities and interconnections between allied social science disciplines and sub-fields of Political Science such as contemporary Indian politics, Comparative Politics, Political Economy, Climate, and International relations. The complexities of real-world challenges and the interconnectedness of socio-political and economic issues necessitate an interdisciplinary approach.
Our internationally recognised faculty deploys contemporary methodologies to prepare students to think critically about the causalities and processes and understand real-world problems to provide solutions. This comprehensive programme prepares students for higher studies and jobs in the industry. This program will hold students in good stead for higher education and relevant career options.
While maintaining the disciplinary focus, the cornerstone of this undergraduate degree is Transdisciplinarity. The courses are located at the unique intersectionality of various disciplines and issues. Learning from multi-disciplinary perspectives gives students a vast horizon, enabling them to make broad connections.    For example, one of the biggest contemporary challenges of climate change can be approached from scientific, economic, historical and sociological viewpoints.
Complimenting the classroom teachings are our Masterclasses, where academics and practitioners are invited to engage with the students on a range of contemporary issues.  This harmonious synergy of academics and practitioners provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the contemporary challenges, encouraging students to think beyond the disciplinary boundaries. These aspects are included organically in our unique curriculums designed by globally renowned faculty.
Our experiential pedagogy through connecting with the neighborhood takes students outside the classroom to face and tackle vexing political-economic-social and policy problems. Guided by our faculty, students are expected to work on live locations to think creatively about social justice, identify problems, provide creative solutions, and connect to real-world issues in this rapidly changing world. Besides, we have a structured fellowship and internship track should students want to delve deeper into specific issues preparing them for the pragmatic application of concepts learnt in the class to the real world.
We firmly believe no undergraduate degree is complete without experiencing the world outside one’s locale. In this light, the program offers ample exchange opportunities with universities in Europe, Asia and North America. Likewise, we also receive exchange students from similar programs worldwide, making our students a part of global classrooms.
All this under the meticulous guidance of our globally trained faculty, some of whom hold PhDs from the world’s top ten universities (QS ranking).
Program Highlights
BA in Political Science is an empirically driven program emphasizing field-based learning. We train students to conduct original enquiry and enable them to make broad causal connections over time.
Students receive individual guidance from the globally renowned faculty to prepare them to make applications for the top 250 universities globally.
The program allows students to explore exchange semesters with legacy varsities in Europe, Asia, and North America. Additionally, the program prepares students to be problem solvers-quality that is much sought after in industry-specific roles.
Going beyond classroom teaching, the program offers praxis-based fellowship opportunities to students. As part of this module, students will be placed as fellows to work with Members of Parliament, Think Tanks, NGOs, Embassies, and International Organizations.
The program trains students to sharpen their research arguments and helps prepare them for group discussions and interviews in academia and industry, enhancing their overall employability.
Future Scope / Industry Trends
A BA in Political Science program offers students a comprehensive understanding of core theories and concepts in Political Science and Public Policy.

Program Details
The globally recognisable programme in Political Science provides students with a conceptual and empirical grounding in Political Science and Public Policy. The programme engages with case studies and field-based research to promote a deeper understanding of our surroundings. This transdisciplinary program teaches students to understand the complementarities and interconnections between allied social science disciplines and sub-fields of Political Science such as contemporary Indian politics, Comparative Politics, Political Economy, Climate, and International relations. The complexities of real-world challenges and the interconnectedness of socio-political and economic issues necessitate an interdisciplinary approach.
Our internationally recognised faculty deploys contemporary methodologies to prepare students to think critically about the causalities and processes and understand real-world problems to provide solutions. This comprehensive programme prepares students for higher studies and jobs in the industry. This program will hold students in good stead for higher education and relevant career options.
While maintaining the disciplinary focus, the cornerstone of this undergraduate degree is Transdisciplinarity. The courses are located at the unique intersectionality of various disciplines and issues. Learning from multi-disciplinary perspectives gives students a vast horizon, enabling them to make broad connections.    For example, one of the biggest contemporary challenges of climate change can be approached from scientific, economic, historical and sociological viewpoints.
Complimenting the classroom teachings are our Masterclasses, where academics and practitioners are invited to engage with the students on a range of contemporary issues.  This harmonious synergy of academics and practitioners provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the contemporary challenges, encouraging students to think beyond the disciplinary boundaries. These aspects are included organically in our unique curriculums designed by globally renowned faculty.
Our experiential pedagogy through connecting with the neighborhood takes students outside the classroom to face and tackle vexing political-economic-social and policy problems. Guided by our faculty, students are expected to work on live locations to think creatively about social justice, identify problems, provide creative solutions, and connect to real-world issues in this rapidly changing world. Besides, we have a structured fellowship and internship track should students want to delve deeper into specific issues preparing them for the pragmatic application of concepts learnt in the class to the real world.
We firmly believe no undergraduate degree is complete without experiencing the world outside one’s locale. In this light, the program offers ample exchange opportunities with universities in Europe, Asia and North America. Likewise, we also receive exchange students from similar programs worldwide, making our students a part of global classrooms.
All this under the meticulous guidance of our globally trained faculty, some of whom hold PhDs from the world’s top ten universities (QS ranking).
