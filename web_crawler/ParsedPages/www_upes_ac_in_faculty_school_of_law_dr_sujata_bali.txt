Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Sujata Bali's teaching style is inspired by Socratic methods. The answers to the questions are truly with the seeker only. She believes that every student matters but also that only a learner can learn. Therefore, a law teacher can inspire, guide, mentor, but never really teach law. Law is as natural to human beings as living in society. Therefore, the teaching of law is limited to familiarizing law students with observing the world around them and noting those aspects of human nature that create law as it is.
