Program Details
The B.Sc. Microbiology program offered by UPES is a comprehensive undergraduate program designed to provide students with a strong foundation in the field of microbiology. The program focuses on studying the biology of microscopic creatures, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, protozoa, and viruses. Students will learn about the impact of microbes on the health of the planet and its inhabitants, as well as their significance in the study of all life forms.
The duration of the program is four years, in line with the New Education Policy (NEP). Upon completion of the first year, students will receive a Certificate in Microbiology. After two years of study, students will be awarded a Diploma in Microbiology. At the end of the third year, students will earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology. In the fourth year, students who achieve a score of 75% and above will qualify for the "BSc Honours by research" in Microbiology. These students will be required to undertake a 15-credit research project and will have the opportunity to directly qualify for a PhD without the need for a Master's degree. Students who achieve a score below 75% will qualify for the "BSc Honors Microbiology" degree. In their final semester, they will engage in industry training or an internship, earning 15 credits. These students will then have to pursue a one-year MSc program to qualify for a PhD.
Program Highlights
Access to advanced facilities and equipment, including a state-of-the-art Aspetic Room (BSL-1), BOD incubators, CO2 incubators, freezers, and centrifuges, to enhance microbiology work.
Students working on projects can utilize the central instrumentation facility offered by UPES R&D, providing them with additional resources and support.
Partnerships with esteemed institutions and organizations like AIIMS, Rishikesh, Biocon Academy, Sun Pharma Research Centre, and Oil India Limited, offering valuable exposure and practical learning opportunities.
Emphasis on practical learning and project-based approaches that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students.
Implementation of teaching methods that involve real-life examples, encourage student engagement, utilize daily assessment tools, gamify the learning process through quizzes and assignments, and leverage open education resources, labs, videos, and simulations.
Provision of professional software training and certification, access to Swayam and NPTEL lectures, and participation in competitive events at the in-house, national, and international levels, promoting holistic development and fostering a competitive spirit.
Future Scope / Industry Trends

Program Details
The B.Sc. Microbiology program offered by UPES is a comprehensive undergraduate program designed to provide students with a strong foundation in the field of microbiology. The program focuses on studying the biology of microscopic creatures, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, protozoa, and viruses. Students will learn about the impact of microbes on the health of the planet and its inhabitants, as well as their significance in the study of all life forms.
The duration of the program is four years, in line with the New Education Policy (NEP). Upon completion of the first year, students will receive a Certificate in Microbiology. After two years of study, students will be awarded a Diploma in Microbiology. At the end of the third year, students will earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology. In the fourth year, students who achieve a score of 75% and above will qualify for the "BSc Honours by research" in Microbiology. These students will be required to undertake a 15-credit research project and will have the opportunity to directly qualify for a PhD without the need for a Master's degree. Students who achieve a score below 75% will qualify for the "BSc Honors Microbiology" degree. In their final semester, they will engage in industry training or an internship, earning 15 credits. These students will then have to pursue a one-year MSc program to qualify for a PhD.
Program Highlights
Access to advanced facilities and equipment, including a state-of-the-art Aspetic Room (BSL-1), BOD incubators, CO2 incubators, freezers, and centrifuges, to enhance microbiology work.
Students working on projects can utilize the central instrumentation facility offered by UPES R&D, providing them with additional resources and support.
Partnerships with esteemed institutions and organizations like AIIMS, Rishikesh, Biocon Academy, Sun Pharma Research Centre, and Oil India Limited, offering valuable exposure and practical learning opportunities.
Emphasis on practical learning and project-based approaches that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students.
Implementation of teaching methods that involve real-life examples, encourage student engagement, utilize daily assessment tools, gamify the learning process through quizzes and assignments, and leverage open education resources, labs, videos, and simulations.
Provision of professional software training and certification, access to Swayam and NPTEL lectures, and participation in competitive events at the in-house, national, and international levels, promoting holistic development and fostering a competitive spirit.
