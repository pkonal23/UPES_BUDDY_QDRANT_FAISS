Assistant Professor

Profile Summary
Mr. Raj Kumar Shukla serves as an esteemed Assistant Professor at SOLSM, where he plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of media professionals. With profound expertise in electronic, digital, and social media, he is entrusted with overseeing critical studio-related activities. He has also been selected to lead the instruction of the specialized subject, Multi-Cam Postproduction, where he imparts his vast knowledge and practical experience to aspiring students. His career is marked by a deep commitment to fostering innovation and excellence in media education.
In recognition of his outstanding capabilities, Mr. Shukla has been entrusted with managing a prestigious, government-funded project from the Department of Science and Technology. His contributions continue to bridge the gap between academic rigor and industry practices, making him a key figure in both academia and media technology.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Mr. Raj Kumar Shukla was closely associated with the prestigious Science Media Communication Cell project under the Ministry of Science, Government of India, where he played a vital role in bridging the gap between science and media communication. Prior to this, he amassed over 17 years of invaluable experience at Zee News, one of India’s leading news channels, where he held various key positions that contributed to his deep understanding of the media industry.

I continuously adapt my teaching methods to align with the rapid advancements in the media industry, ensuring that my students are well-equipped with modern tools and techniques. By blending practical training with up-to-date knowledge, I strive to prepare students to excel in the dynamic and ever-evolving world of media.
Courses Taught
My entire professional experience is rooted in the media industry, specifically in the production department. This background fuels my passion for teaching, as I always strive to share my real-world media experience in the classroom. By bringing practical insights and industry knowledge directly to my students, I create an engaging and immersive learning environment. Sharing this wealth of experience is not just my responsibility—it's my passion, and it allows me to inspire the next generation of media professionals.

Teaching Philosophy

Mr. Raj Kumar Shukla’s teaching philosophy is deeply rooted in a practical, hands-on approach, as media courses are inherently practical in nature. I firmly believe in a balanced methodology, where 70% of the learning experience is focused on practical application, and 30% is dedicated to theory, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of both. I continuously adapt my teaching methods to align with the rapid advancements in the media industry, ensuring that my students are well-equipped with modern tools and techniques. By blending practical training with up-to-date knowledge, I strive to prepare students to excel in the dynamic and ever-evolving world of media.

Courses Taught
My entire professional experience is rooted in the media industry, specifically in the production department. This background fuels my passion for teaching, as I always strive to share my real-world media experience in the classroom. By bringing practical insights and industry knowledge directly to my students, I create an engaging and immersive learning environment. Sharing this wealth of experience is not just my responsibility—it's my passion, and it allows me to inspire the next generation of media professionals.
