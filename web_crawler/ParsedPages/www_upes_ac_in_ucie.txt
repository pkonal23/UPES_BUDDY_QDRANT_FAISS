UCIE Partners
UCIE aims to build an entrepreneurial ecosystem in Uttarakhand and empower the existing stakeholders by providing them a network to share/discuss/leverage areas of common interest. This is achieved by conducting a series of events with its network, comprising the local community, state government departments, NGOs, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) and the PHD Chamber of Commerce by providing information about UCIE and its activities. This facilitates mutual cooperation and growth of entrepreneurship in the Uttarakhand region, invariably resulting in increased business, data bases, foreign investors and export opportunities.
Objectives
Create a conducive and professional environment for entrepreneurial activities
Provide resources to aspiring entrepreneurs to start their companies
Impart mentoring services to young businesses
Help in financing businesses
Provide R&D infrastructure for innovation-based start-ups
Assist in commercialisation of intellectual property
Provide consultancy in business planning, market research and corporate development
Generate business opportunities in the area of renewable energy and green technology
Develop strong alliances with regional businesses and technology communities through incubation programs
Incubation Model
UCIE provides a platform to students, aspiring entrepreneurs, technology start-ups as well as lab-stage innovations to flourish. It promotes critical thinking which is not constrained by resources so one can become an entrepreneur or a successful corporate professional. UCIE encourages talent and innovation by giving opportunities to the potential change-makers, thereby contributing towards bringing a social and economic transformation.

Workshops
The workshops developed by UCIE are framed around businesses and involve academic researchers and professionals from the industry. The workshops are organised to provide basic understanding of what it takes to commercialize and thrive in the market. Supported by the faculty of UPES and industry experts, these workshops cover a wide variety of topics, viz. industry analysis, technical feasibility study, market feasibility, demand forecasting, financial feasibility study, and strategy development. The theoretical knowledge is enhanced by the industry experts and entrepreneurs, who also share their personal experiences with the participants.
