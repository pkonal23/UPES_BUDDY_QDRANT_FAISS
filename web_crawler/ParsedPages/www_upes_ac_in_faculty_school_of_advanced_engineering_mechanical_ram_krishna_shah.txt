Profile Summary
Dr. Ram Krishna completed his Ph.D. in the Fluid and Thermal Science stream, a subdomain of Mechanical Engineering, from IIT Kanpur. His research focuses on developing next-generation thermal management techniques for high heat flux removal, with applications in power electronics and the EV industry. Additionally, he explores renewable and sustainable energy domains, specifically atmospheric water harvesting and off-grid cooling solutions. Dr. Ram Krishna has gained valuable work experience through his associations with esteemed national institutions such as IIT Madras, IISc Bangalore, and IIT Kanpur. His research contributions have been recognized at various national and international conferences.
Work Experience
Before joining UPES, Dr. Ram was pursuing his Ph.D. at IIT Kanpur, where he gained expertise in both experimental and computational studies in the fluid and thermal science domain. He has published numerous research articles in reputed international journals and conferences. Prior to his Ph.D., he worked as a Design Engineer at a collaborative start-up between IISc Bangalore and Suryagen Renewable Energy. He also worked as a Project Associate at IIT Kanpur, where he contributed to the development of cost-effective off-grid cooling solutions for remote areas.
Research Interests
Dr. Ram Krishna's research interests encompass active and passive thermal management systems, renewable and sustainable energy engineering, multiphase flow, microfluidics, colloids, and interfacial science, all within the broader domain of fluid and thermal science.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Ram's teaching philosophy revolves around integrating theory with practical learning to enhance effective learning. He promotes a "learning by doing" approach and keeps students motivated by demonstrating real-life applications of the subject matter. He encourages independent thinking among students and imparts in-depth understanding to develop insights applicable to various scenarios. Dr. Ram actively involves students in learning relevant software platforms, enhancing their future employability, and emphasising the acquisition of skills useful in the professional sphere.
Courses Taught
Dr. Ram Krishna teaches both core and elective courses within the Mechanical and Aerospace streams. His instructional experience covers introductory and advanced-level courses on Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, and Multiphase Flows for undergraduate and postgraduate students. Additionally, he provides training in advanced software skills in the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) domain, preparing students for their future careers.
Awards and Grants
During his undergraduate studies at IIITDM Kancheepuram, Dr. Ram received the merit cum means (MCM) scholarship. He demonstrated excellence by scoring among the top 2% at the national level in the JEE Mains (previously AIEEE) examination in 2007. He was also awarded the Graduate Research Fellowship for his doctoral studies at IIT Kanpur. Notably, he received the Best Paper Award for one of his conference papers presented at the IHMTC - 2017 conference by the Indian Society for Heat and Mass Transfer.
Scholarly Activities
Dr. Ram Krishna's research work primarily revolves around fluid and thermal science, focusing on the development of active and passive cooling methods for high heat flux management. He particularly emphasizes the application of passive cooling techniques, such as heat pipes, in high heat flux scenarios from power electronics and electric vehicle domains. His research contributions include multiple published articles on active cooling techniques for high heat flux management. Furthermore, he explores renewable and sustainable energy domains, specifically atmospheric water harvesting and off-grid cooling solutions for arid and remote locations.
