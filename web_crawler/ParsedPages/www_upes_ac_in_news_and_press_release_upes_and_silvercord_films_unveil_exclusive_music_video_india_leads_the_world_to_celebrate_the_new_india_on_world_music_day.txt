UPES and Silvercord Films Unveil Exclusive Music Video 'India Leads the World’ To Celebrate the New India on World Music Day

UPES and Silvercord Films Unveil Exclusive Music Video 'India Leads the World’ To Celebrate the New India on World Music Day

Marking World Music Day, UPES released a soulful music video to celebrate the spirit of the nation. The video is an artistic and musical expression of ‘India Leads the World and pays homage to the remarkable transformations unfolding in every aspect of India’s growth. This musical extravaganza, produced in collaboration with Silvercord Films, cherishes the work of great Indian musical maestros whose original rendition ‘Mile Sur Mera Tumhara’ struck a chord with every Indian.
The video has been completely performed by the students and faculty of UPES. Even senior leaders such as the Chairman, the Vice Chancellor and the Deans can be seen joining them in the video. They were also joined by staff members including security guards, gardeners, office boys, housekeeping ladies and more.
This collective representation reflects a truly refreshing approach to education embodying inclusivity, respect, and passion, all of which are the core values of UPES.
Opening with a powerful address by Sharad Mehra, Chairman, Hydrocarbons Education Research Society (HERS), the video puts a spotlight on various art forms, from the graceful art of Bharatnatyam, and dynamic contemporary dance performances, to the powerful lyrics that perfectly stitch together this modern yet rooted rendition.
“Today, India is a force to be reckoned with. We are known as much for technology as for ancient philosophy and life-changing education that values humanity and knowledge, equally. With pride and patriotic enthusiasm, our students and staff have come together to salute the incredible new India through this soulful performance. We’re thrilled to share this celebration of national pride, with our fellow Indians,”
added
Dr. Ram K Sharma, Vice Chancellor, UPES.
Available on
YouTube
and
Spotify
, the music in this video is composed by Nishant Ramteke, a young talented music maestro from Maharashtra. “
When UPES approached me for this interesting collaboration, the intention, and the attempt of a homegrown piece of art inspired me to take this up. With a beautiful mix of old and new streams, we have been able to push boundaries and create something which is democratic and diverse in its nature and form
”, shares
Yashasvi Juyal, Film Director and Screenwriter
at Silvercord Films.
The music video pays a proud tribute to a new India which is leading the change that the world is witnessing. It celebrates India not just as the youngest country in the world, the largest democracy on this planet, the next economic, political, and social superpower but above all, as the largest human-centred nation that has become a global inspiration.
