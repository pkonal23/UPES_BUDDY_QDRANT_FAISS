Dr. Srinivasa Reddy Devarapu

Associate Professor

Profile Summary
Dr. Srinivasa Reddy Devarapu brings a rich blend of industry and academic experience to his career. His previous roles include being an Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Koneru Lakshmaiah University, Andhra Pradesh, before joining UPES. With a Ph.D. earned in 2015 from IIT Madras, focusing on in-situ combustion-based enhanced oil recovery, he's a recognized authority in his field.
During his tenure in academia, Dr. Devarapu's contributions have been substantial. He actively shaped petroleum engineering curricula at JNTU Kakinada and KL University and held roles such as committee member and chairman for their respective BOS committees. Further, he played a pivotal role in establishing and enhancing petroleum engineering laboratories, demonstrating his commitment to academic excellence. Dr. Devarapu's research spans areas like mathematical modeling of reservoir flow, eco-friendly drilling fluids, and adsorbents for water treatment. His research has been featured in numerous international journals and patents, solidifying his impact on the field.
Work Experience
Srinivasa Reddy Devarapu boasts a dynamic career, including roles as an Associate Professor and Assistant Professor in the Energy Cluster at UPES Dehradun. He also served as an Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at KL University, along with positions at DIT University and ESSAR STEELS Ltd. His journey commenced with Apprentice Training at HPCL. This diverse trajectory reflects his dedication to both academic growth and industry engagement.
Research Interests
Enhanced Oil Recovery, Modeling of flow through porous media, Drilling fluids, Oil-water treatment.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Srinivasa Reddy holds the ideology that the ultimate purpose of education is to foster continuous learning. He firmly believes in the principle that teaching and learning should be intertwined. With this viewpoint, he strives to create a conducive environment that supports and encourages students' learning process. In his classes, he has implemented the concept of "flipping the classroom," incorporating pre-reading assignments. Before attending class, students are assigned sections of the textbook and other resources to read. These assignments are followed by quizzes and predefined tasks that assist students in comprehending real-time solutions related to flow through petroleum reservoirs.
