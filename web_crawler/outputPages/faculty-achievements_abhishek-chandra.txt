This work aims to utilize ultrasound and osmotic dehydration as pretreatment strategies to preserve the rich composition of papaya during conventional hot air drying. The dried papaya slices were evaluated for moisture content, water activity, total phenolic content, β-carotene, color, antioxidant activity, microstructure, and texture. The study concludes that pretreatment of papaya slices with ultrasound and osmotic dehydration is recommended before drying.
