Faculty
Mr. Raj Kumar Shukla’s teaching philosophy is deeply rooted in a practical, hands-on approach, as media courses are inherently practical in nature. I firmly believe in a balanced methodology, where 70% of the learning experience is focused on practical application, and 30% is dedicated to theory, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of both. I continuously adapt my teaching methods to align with the rapid advancements in the media industry, ensuring that my students are well-equipped with modern tools and techniques. By blending practical training with up-to-date knowledge, I strive to prepare students to excel in the dynamic and ever-evolving world of media.
