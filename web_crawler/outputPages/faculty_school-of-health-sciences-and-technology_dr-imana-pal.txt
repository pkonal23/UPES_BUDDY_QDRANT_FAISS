Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Imana Pal is a food and nutrition expert with considerable research background in nutrition, product development, and health sciences. She received her PhD from the University of Calcutta, where her studies focused on the nutritional analysis, product development, and sensory evaluation of an indigenous fruit, as well as its health impacts in animal models. This study investigated the potential health advantages of native foods, focusing on their function in nutrition and disease prevention.
