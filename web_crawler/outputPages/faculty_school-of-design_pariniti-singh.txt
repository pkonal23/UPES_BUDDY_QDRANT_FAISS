My design classroom thrives on hands-on experiences. I believe students learn best by diving into real-world problems and crafting solutions. We embark on projects that challenge them to think critically, iterate on ideas, and refine their design skills. But it's not just about the final product; I see myself as a mentor and friend, guiding them through the creative process while fostering a supportive environment where they feel comfortable taking risks and exploring their unique design voices.
