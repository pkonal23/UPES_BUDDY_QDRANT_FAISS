I am delighted to report that the momentum in research activities at UPES has continued to accelerate through the first half of 2024, building upon our achievements from the previous year. The unwavering commitment of our faculty and students continues to drive our progress. Our investment in research infrastructure remains steadfast. The Central Instrumentation Centre has seen further enhancements, fostering even more robust interdisciplinary collaborations across our schools. These improvements have already yielded tangible results, with several breakthrough projects currently underway. The international impact of our research publications continues to grow. Our faculty members and research scholars have presented their work at prestigious international conferences, further elevating UPES's global research profile. I'm particularly proud to announce that three of our students have received the INSPIRE award this year, while five have secured CSIR NET fellowships. Additionally, we've seen a record number of qualifications in UGC NET and GATE, underscoring the quality of our academic programs and the caliber of our students. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to our esteemed faculty, dedicated researchers, and passionate students for their invaluable contributions. Your efforts continue to shape UPES into a beacon of knowledge, innovation, and transformative ideas.

Analysis can track the changes in the mass of your sample as the temperature is changed in a controlled manner. Analysis typically consists of monitoring the mass of your sample while heating at a constant rate, or held at a constant temperature over time. Differential Scanning Calorimetry can track the changes in the heat flow to and from a sample as the temperature is changed in a controlled manner. The sample may be subjected to some heating and cooling cycle(s) in an inert or oxidizing environment. Each of these cycles may provide different information.

Research is the central pillar of UPES, that is not only conducted but also driven by eminent faculty. To widen the roots of research in the institution, a new scheme titled "SHODH" is launched especially for undergraduate students. The scheme aims to enable the students to innovate through investigations and validations under the guidance of expert faculty members. The scheme introduces the students to the research eco-system at UPES to promote product development and entrepreneurship. The scheme encourages the student to embark into multidisciplinary research by choosing their own teams and mentors. From the year of its inception, the scheme has delivered outcomes in the form of patents, products and original research articles that are published with high impact journals and also start-up.

Thin anti-reflection coatings on glass for optical applications are also deposited by sputtering. Because of the low substrate temperatures used, sputtering is an ideal method to deposit contact metals for thin film transistors. Another familiar application of sputtering is low-emissivity coatings on glass, used in double-pane window assemblies. The coating is a multilayer containing silver and metal oxides such as zinc oxide, tin oxide, or titanium dioxide. A large industry has developed around tool bit coating using sputtered nitrides, such as titanium nitride, creating the familiar gold colored hard coat. Sputtering is also used as the process to deposit the metal (e.g. aluminium) layer during the fabrication of CDs and DVDs.

In GIXRD, the incident angle of the X-ray beam hitting the sample is adjusted relative to the critical angle of the reflected X-rays in the same way as in X-ray reflectivity, with which the structural properties of thin films can be determined. The critical angle of the reflected X-ray beam is unique for every material and is generally very small. The higher the incident angle relative to the critical angle of the material, the deeper the X-rays go down into the material. Therefore, if the incident angle of the X-rays rises above the critical angle, the depth of the penetrating X-rays increases rapidly. When the incident angle is smaller than the critical angle, the X-rays go through the sample only a few nanometers.
