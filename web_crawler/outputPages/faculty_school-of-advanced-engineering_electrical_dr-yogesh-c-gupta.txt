He creates an environment that supports and encourages student learning. He has incorporated some elements of "flipping the classroom" into his classes, such as pre-reading assignments, in which students read assigned sections of the textbook and/or other resources before coming to class, where they complete a short quiz. Quiz material is not repeated in class but instead is used as the foundation for in-class assignments that involve students working with real data and situations. Using authentic problems helps students move from novice to expert thinking.
