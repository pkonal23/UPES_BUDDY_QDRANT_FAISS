The COVID-19 pandemic saw an explosion of social media activity as people around the world shared updates, news, and resources. Platforms like Twitter became hubs for real-time information from journalists, healthcare professionals, and government agencies. Journalists used social media to monitor public sentiment, debunk misinformation, and provide updates on the virus’s spread. For instance, when vaccines were developed, journalists used social media to report on distribution efforts and clarify misinformation about vaccine safety, often relying on hashtags like #COVID19 and #VaccinesWork.

Imagine a world where news spreads at lightning speed. That’s the reality of social media—a platform where a tweet can reach millions in seconds and a Facebook post can ignite global discussions. For journalists, this was a game-changer. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram gave reporters direct access to their audience, allowing them to break stories without the traditional gatekeepers of print and broadcast media.
The constant exposure to criticism, especially online, can take a toll on journalists’ mental health. Negative comments, threats, and harassment are not uncommon, and the fast-paced nature of social media can lead to burnout.

Stories are an age-old way of imparting information and education across the world. Storytelling is an important and effective tool in the interview process.
Social media platforms use algorithms that tend to reinforce users' existing beliefs. This can create echo chambers where people only see news that aligns with their views, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives and fostering polarization.

Social media refers to a collection of online platforms and applications that allow people to create, share, and exchange content with a global audience. Unlike traditional media, which delivers content one-way, social media is interactive and enables two-way communication. Popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok allow users to share photos, videos, articles, and personal updates in real-time. These platforms have transformed how people consume information, making news more accessible and interactive than ever before.
