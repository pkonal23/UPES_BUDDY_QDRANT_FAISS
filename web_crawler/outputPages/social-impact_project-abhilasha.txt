Social Impact
Project Abhilasha
Children are often deprived of education due to inequalities that emanate from socio-economic status, gender and cultural identities. The idea behind this project is to identify meritorious students from the marginalized regions of the state and invite them for a month-long residential coaching camp on the campus. The focus is on strengthening their grasp of subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, and Maths, thereby making them ready for engineering entrance exams.
