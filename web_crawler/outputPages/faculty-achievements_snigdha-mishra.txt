This study reveals that in Drosophila melanogaster (an excellent model alternative to conventional vertebrate models), the seminal protein, Sex Peptide coordinates with crucial female factors to regulate the post-mating events that a mated female exhibits to achieve the optimal reproductive performance. The study adds to the scarce data available to support that female contributions are also needed to regulate the levels of SP associated with sperm stored in their storage sites and that the SP-regulated process is not entirely male-biased.
Snigdha Mishra, led and published an interesting study covering her post-doctoral research work from Mariana. F. Wolfner lab, Cornell University “Female factors modulate Sex Peptide’s association with sperm in Drosophila melanogaster.”
