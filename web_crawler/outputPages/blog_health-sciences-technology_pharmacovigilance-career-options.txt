A Journey into the Intriguing World of B.Sc. in Chemistry
India, known as the “Pharmacy of the World,” is crucial in global pharmaceutical manufacturing and exports. With such a vast pharmaceutical landscape, ensuring drug safety has become more important than ever. This is where pharmacovigilance (PV) comes into play, focusing on the detection, assessment, and prevention of adverse drug reactions (ADRs)/ Indian ADR.
What is Pharmacovigilance?
Chemical engineers play an integral role in the pharmaceutical industry, blending their expertise in chemical processes with innovative problem-solving to enhance drug development and production.
With India's expanding pharmaceutical industry and increasing regulatory scrutiny from bodies like the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), the importance of pharmacovigilance has surged. India is part of the World Health Organization (WHO) Programme for International Drug Monitoring, and initiatives like the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI) have been launched to strengthen drug safety monitoring nationwide.
