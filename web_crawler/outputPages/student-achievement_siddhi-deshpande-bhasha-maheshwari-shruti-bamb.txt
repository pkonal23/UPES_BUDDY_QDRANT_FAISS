The brainchild of three creative design students, Siddhi Deshpande, Bhasha Maheshwari, and Shruti Maheshwari, is their product Vendo. This remarkable creation addresses hygiene management in public restrooms with a sustainable, accessible, and eco-friendly approach. Vendo is ingeniously designed as a fusion of a sanitary napkin vending machine and an incinerator. This unique combination facilitates the easy disposal of used napkins through the incinerator, while the vending section ensures round-the-clock availability of sanitary napkins. The machine operates with a nominal token fee of INR 5, offering three distinct pad size options.
