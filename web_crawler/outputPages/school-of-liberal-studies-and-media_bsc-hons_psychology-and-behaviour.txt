Further Information
Central to our educational philosophy is the belief in learning by doing. We firmly believe that true understanding and appreciation of psychological concepts arise from practical application. Each course in our programme includes a practical component designed to engage students actively. For instance, students engage in creating visually captivating posters. These posters not only serve as educational tools but also ignite meaningful conversations within the community, showcasing the creativity and academic rigour of our students. Additionally, students observe master therapists in action, participate in role-plays, and conduct mock counselling sessions. This immersive experience, complemented by faculty mentorship, equips students with the skills needed for real-world practice.
