Assistant Professor-Selection Grade
During the internship at IIRS, ISRO, Ishika Punhani & Vinay K conceptualized and constructed a Computational Model known as "Landscape Forensics." This pioneering model harnesses the power of machine intelligence to forecast the potential risk of disasters, encompassing a wide array of calamities such as Landslides, Cloudbursts, Floods, and Forest Fires. By coining the term "Landscape Forensics," they introduced an innovative paradigm to disaster risk prediction. This initiative marks a significant advancement in leveraging technology for enhancing disaster preparedness and management
