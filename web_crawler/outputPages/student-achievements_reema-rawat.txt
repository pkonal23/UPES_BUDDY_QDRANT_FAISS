This new tool can help find cervical cancer early, especially the kind caused by HPV-16, a key biomarker. Utilising an electrochemical biosensor, the device becomes more user-friendly, cost-effective and highly accessible making early detection possible so that the people in places with limited resources can get tested. In trials, this device worked well with clinical data and showcased a great potential to significantly lower cervical cancer mortality rates by facilitating early and non-invasive testing.
