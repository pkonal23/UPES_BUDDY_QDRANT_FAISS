Students quoted, â€œIn this project, we delve into the intricate world of formulating and characterizing probiotic beverages. With the ability to enhance the immune system, probiotics have become a key player in maintaining our well-being. The primary objective of this endeavour is to craft beverages that are abundant in probiotic goodness, complete with live microorganisms that alleviate the discomfort of bloating and the formation of gas. Ultimately, these meticulously designed concoctions improve the digestibility within our bodies while curbing our consumption of excessive sugar found in sweetened beverages.
