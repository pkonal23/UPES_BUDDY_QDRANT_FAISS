Teaching Philosophy
Close
Dr. Tabassum is recognised for her work in different areas such as credit derivatives and credit risk management. Her research work focuses on credit default swaps, the most recent financial innovation. The research demonstrates that how banks can use credit default swaps to hedge or manage the credit risk of their banks.
The foundation of Dr. Tabassum's teaching philosophy is the conviction that it is the duty of a teacher to foster an environment that promotes and encourages student learning. Pre-reading assignments, in which students study assigned passages from the textbook and/or other materials before going to class, where they complete a brief quiz, are some of the "flipping the classroom" components she has integrated into her classes.
