Unlocking the Potential of a Bachelor of Design Education
Despite India’s ongoing efforts to improve rural education, significant challenges still persist in delivering quality education to rural students. Issues like inadequate infrastructure, a shortage of qualified teachers, language barriers, economic hardships, and gender bias continue to hinder progress in rural education. With rural India representing approximately 65% of the total population, around 880 million people, addressing these challenges is of utmost importance. The literacy rate in rural India, as of 2021, stands at approximately 73.5%, with male literacy at 81% and female literacy at 65%. Since the rural economy contributes significantly to the nation’s GDP (25-30%), improving literacy in these areas is vital for India’s economic growth. To enhance rural education, a multifaceted approach is necessary, encompassing policy development, monitoring and evaluation, research and innovation, technology integration, and mentorship initiatives. This strategy begins with the formulation of comprehensive government policies focused on rural education. Adequate budget allocation is crucial to addressing infrastructure deficiencies, enhancing teacher recruitment, and improving overall educational quality in rural schools. Moreover, a dedicated budget ensures the sustainability of these educational enhancements. Regular monitoring and evaluation play an equally vital role, providing a systematic framework to assess the effectiveness of policies and programs. Key performance indicators and feedback mechanisms enable data-driven adjustments to achieve optimal outcomes. To foster innovation and overcome unique challenges faced by rural education, investment in research initiatives and collaborations between educational institutions, researchers, government bodies, private organisations, and civil society is essential.

Digital tools boost progress and student engagement in education. With the increasing pace of globalisation, it is essential to recognise that we should not deny any community access to the same services and opportunities as everyone else. In today’s education system, the goal for students with special needs is to allow them to participate in the same activities and learn the same material as their non-disabled peers. This can be an empowering experience for students with special needs. Instead of segregating them in separate classrooms, teachers are now finding ways to allow students with special needs to showcase their knowledge and talents, and technology can make this possible. Technology can be integrated with education to ensure that those with learning disabilities are not left behind. Recent technology advances have significantly improved accessibility for students with disabilities in higher education. Some notable developments include AI-Powered services, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), 3D printing technology, Wearable sensory devices, accessible learning management systems (LMS), online collaboration and communication tools, gesture and voice control technology, more precise and automated closed captioning services, and more.

University Grants Commission (UGC) has introduced new draft guidelines requiring undergraduate students to undertake mandatory internships. This initiative aims to align the undergraduate curriculum with the NEP’s emphasis on incorporating research and internships, offering students valuable opportunities for hands-on experience.
In the past two years, India’s skilling landscape has seen notable improvements. Recent reports highlight a significant emphasis on skill development, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM), as well as life skills. As India sets its sights on achieving a $5 trillion economy, it is imperative to align our skill development efforts with global demands. The rapid advancement of digital technology has led to significant global changes and challenges, amplifying the need for digital transformation in education.
As we stride confidently towards a brighter future, it is equally essential to draw inspiration from our past and remain firmly rooted in our nation’s rich history and traditions. India has been a repository of diverse cultures, reflected in our art, literary masterpieces, customs, traditions, languages, artefacts, heritage sites, and more. Preserving and promoting this cultural heritage is not just a duty but also a matter of national pride and strength. Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and his ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ initiative, a noteworthy endeavour is underway. This initiative seeks to identify 100 tourist destinations in India where educational institutions will send students to explore the history, scientific contributions, traditions, indigenous literature, and knowledge associated with these locales. This initiative aims to acquaint students with the rich cultural and natural heritage that makes India truly “incredible.”
The policy underscores the importance of accountability in the education system. It encourages institutions, teachers, and students to take responsibility for their roles in the learning process. This extends to promoting ethical values and environmental sustainability.

The great aim of education is not knowledge but action. This quote by British Polymath and philosopher Herbert Spencer continues to hold relevance even today in the field of education, as it underscores the idea that the goal of education goes beyond accumulating knowledge. Instead, education is a means to empower individuals to act, apply what they’ve learned, and make a positive impact on the world. Education is seen as a journey that nurtures individuals, unleashes their potential, and serves as a potent catalyst for social cohesion. It imparts values that foster connections among people of various backgrounds. The OECD Future of Education and Skills 2030 project identifies competencies (knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values) that students today need to develop in order to shape a future world.
