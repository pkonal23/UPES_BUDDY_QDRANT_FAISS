Social Impact
Project Naman
Under the project, besides financial assistance to the family of the martyrs, UPES shall:
Offer full higher education scholarships to the children of five martyrs from Uttarakhand every year
Support the dependent of the martyr in finding job opportunities
There are countless stories of gallant men from the Kumaon and Garhwal Regiments who have laid down their lives in the line of duty. It is because of their sacrifices that Uttarakhand is known not only as Dev Bhumi, but also Veer Bhumi. As a premier institution of higher learning in the state, UPES believes in creating and sustaining long-lasting impact by caring for the community in which it thrives. While no measure can ever be enough to compensate for the loss of lives, UPES seeks to salute the bravehearts by caring for their bereaved families, both financially and otherwise, through a social initiative named Naman.

The project is an extension of the Shaheed Memorial T-20 Cricket Tournament, an annual event conceptualised in the year 2014, wherein eight teams had participated, which gradually increased to 20 Government/Public Sector Undertakings teams in the year 2020. Organised on a no-profit basis, the tournament is majorly sponsored by UPES and its employees. The participating teams also donate voluntarily to the cause.
