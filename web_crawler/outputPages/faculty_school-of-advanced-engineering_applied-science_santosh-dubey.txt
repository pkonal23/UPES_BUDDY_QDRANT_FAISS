His team of students was also a semi-finalist in IICDC 2017 organized by the Department of Science & Technology and Texas Instruments, receiving a cash prize of INR 20000. Along with his team, he also received a consultancy project \from ABB Bangalore to develop a theoretical/computational framework for shale gas production from reservoirs. Additionally, he has received research projects from IUAC, New Delhi, and UGC-DAE-CSR, Indore, to work on phase transformation in Ni/Si thin films using ion-beam irradiation and thermal annealing.
Professor Dubey's research interests include understanding phase transformation in materials under thermal and irradiation conditions using mathematical modelling and experimentation. Presently, he is working on synthesizing Nickel Silicides through annealing and ion beam irradiation, with potential applications in microelectronics, solar photovoltaics, and other fields.
Contact
Before joining UPES, Professor Dubey served as a post-doctoral research associate at the School of Nuclear Engineering, Purdue University, USA. During his tenure at Purdue, he focused on developing mathematical models to simulate the behaviour of structural materials under intensely irradiated environments. He also worked as a Scientist at the Institute for Plasma Research (IPR), Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India. In this capacity, he played a vital role in developing a data acquisition system to monitor temperature and power density profiles of plasma particles on first wall components in the Steady State Superconducting Tokamak (SST-1), a project aimed at achieving nuclear fusion for green energy production.
Prof. Dubey, along with a team of researchers from UPES Dehradun, executed an externally funded consultancy project from ABB Bangalore to develop a theoretical/computational framework for understanding shale gas and production from reservoirs. He has also executed research projects on ion-beam-induced phase transformations in materials, finding applications in areas like solar photovoltaics, microelectronics, etc.
