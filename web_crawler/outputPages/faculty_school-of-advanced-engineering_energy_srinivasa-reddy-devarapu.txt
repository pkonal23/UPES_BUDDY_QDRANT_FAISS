Dr. Srinivasa Reddy holds the ideology that the ultimate purpose of education is to foster continuous learning. He firmly believes in the principle that teaching and learning should be intertwined. With this viewpoint, he strives to create a conducive environment that supports and encourages students' learning process. In his classes, he has implemented the concept of "flipping the classroom," incorporating pre-reading assignments. Before attending class, students are assigned sections of the textbook and other resources to read. These assignments are followed by quizzes and predefined tasks that assist students in comprehending real-time solutions related to flow through petroleum reservoirs.
