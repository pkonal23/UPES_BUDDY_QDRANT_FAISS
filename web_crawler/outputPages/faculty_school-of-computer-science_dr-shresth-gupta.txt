Shresth Gupta's teaching philosophy is rooted in fostering a dynamic and engaging learning environment that empowers students to grasp complex concepts effectively. Central to his approach is the use of analogies and demonstrations, which serve as powerful tools for elucidating abstract ideas and making them relatable to real-world scenarios. Shresth firmly believes in the importance of community-based learning, where students collaborate within groups to undertake projects and exchange their diverse skill sets. By creating such an ecosystem, students not only enhance their understanding of the subject matter but also cultivate essential teamwork and communication skills. Moreover, Shresth is committed to inspiring students to actively participate in research activities relevant to their fields of study. Encouraging students to delve deeper into research not only broadens their knowledge base but also instils a deeper appreciation for the subject matter. Through these principles, Shresth aims to empower students to become critical thinkers, problem solvers, and lifelong learners in their academic and professional journeys.
Awarded with the certification of National Institute of Technical Teachers Training, Bhopal.
