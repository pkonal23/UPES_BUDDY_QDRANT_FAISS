Contact
Prior to joining UPES, Dr. Pande was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Molecular Cardiology Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, USA. Over there, she led a study to evaluate how AAV9-mediated mediated MLK3 overexpression affects the left ventricular hypertrophy in mice with TAC-induced pressure overload. Her earlier research at the University of Massachusetts Lowell focused on structural and functional analysis of proteins, with a focus on ERAP1 and GA enzymes. She identified key residues in the hydrophobic pocket of ERAP1 that significantly affect the recognition and binding of precursor antigenic peptides, crucial for immunogenic response. Using recombinant protein production and X-ray crystallography techniques she also investigated structural alterations in GA enzyme caused by point mutations that leads to a rare disease called aspartylglucosaminuria.
