This research paper revealed a detailed study on rice bran protein concentrate treated by ultrasonication with a detailed characterization. The treatment effect on the microstructure of the rice bran protein was investigated to elucidate the protein structure that enhances the functional properties. This article is very important for the food industry and for researchers to find methods capable of improving the functional properties of plant proteins.
