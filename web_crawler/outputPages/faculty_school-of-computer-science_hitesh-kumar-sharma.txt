Dr. Hitesh considers teaching a significant and rewarding part of his career. He has experience in teaching as an instructor for a number of courses. Challenges in instructing graduate and postgraduate students for his is finding ways to bring the students down into the nuts and bolts of the course and develop a system-level design approach without squandering their initial enthusiasm from the higher-level discussion. He found that allowing breadth in their final thesis/project report let the students explore any aspect of the topic of their interest while the tests and programming assignments provided a more hands-on working knowledge of computer algorithms in real-life implementation. His aim is to make frequent use of examples and motivate ideas by placing them in the context of both their applications and abstract generalizations. He favours a tutorial style of teaching that mixes lecturing with problem sessions in which students apply the ideas they are learning. This changes lectures from a passive experience to an interactive one and helps the teacher correct misapprehensions early on before the studentâ€™s tackle homework assignments on their own.
