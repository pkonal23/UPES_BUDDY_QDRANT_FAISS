Mr. Yeole received the First Prize Award for his Presentation entitled "Newer insights into green and low-cost zeolitic adsorbents for adsorptive desulfurization of liquid transportation fuels" at the International Conference, SuschemE 2015, organized by ICT.
Research Interests
Mr. Yeole's teaching philosophy is centred around fostering subject interest among students through creative and innovative learning. He incorporates student learning and assessments using animations/video demonstrations and research papers. He strongly advocates for student assessments through open-ended and industry-based assignments, allowing students to identify industrial problems, select variables and data aligned with industrial processes, and design their own equipment with certain assumptions.
