Social Impact
Home
Everyone sees the world through their own prism. This project recognizes the fact that all children have their own perception of the world. These are images that are strongly shaped by their individual imagination and experiences. On the occasion of the World Book Day, five students from government primary schools, along with their teachers and principals, participated in a painting competition on the theme of ‘environment’. The winners took home trophies, while all participants got a bag, books and stationery as gifts.
