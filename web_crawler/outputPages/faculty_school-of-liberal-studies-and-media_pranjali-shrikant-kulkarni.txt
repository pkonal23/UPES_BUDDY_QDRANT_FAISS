Scholarly Activities
Pranjali has an academic background of interdisciplinary research. She has pursued her under graduation from Tata institute of Social Sciences Hyderabad and further moved to do her MSc in Cognitive Science at IIT Gandhinagar. With curious inclination towards understanding mysteries of language cognition and philosophy of science, Pranjali joined IIT Gandhinagar for PhD in Cognitive and Brain Sciences. Her doctoral research emphasizes understanding the formation and perception of linguistic meanings within Cognitive Science. She identified challenges in experimental research on linguistic meanings, which were influenced by structuralist approaches. Her work advocates for a context-driven understanding of linguistic meanings, drawing upon Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophical framework.
Courses Taught
Eligibility Criteria
Pranjali's research interests center on language and meaning within the realms of cognition and the Philosophy of Science. She employs insights from Wittgenstein to explore how context influences linguistic meanings and their implications for human cognition. By challenging traditional structuralist approaches, she advocates for a context-driven perspective that embraces subjective interpretations and embodied experiences. Pranjali is dedicated to examining how philosophical inquiries can inform empirical research in cognitive science, particularly regarding the nature of meaning. Her future projects will investigate the implications of language processing systems in artificial intelligence, focusing on decision-making and ethical considerations in the intersection of language and cognition.

Profile Summary
Assistant Professor
Pranjali was awarded silver medal for second highest score in BASS program at TISS Hyderabad. She was also awarded gold medal for highest score in MSc at IITGn. Recipient of project scholarship for re-inventing Japan Project- JAIST-India Cooperative Program for frontier scientists with Global Sense in Advanced Science and Technology.
As a Graduate Teaching Fellow at IIT Gandhinagar, Pranjali led the postgraduate course Embodied Cognition and Methods of Phenomenology, emphasizing the role of embodied experiences in cognitive processes. She delivered guest lectures across various postgraduate courses, including Cognitive Linguistics, where she explored the historical context and core tenets of the field. In the Introduction to Linguistics course, she discussed Language and the Brain, focusing on how brain research informs our understanding of language. In the Writing Course, she guided students in developing essential academic reading skills. Additionally, her guest lecture in Cognitive Psychology addressed Early Language Acquisition and the complexities of cracking the speech code.
Pranjali's teaching philosophy emphasizes interdisciplinary learning and the development of conceptual strength in Psychology and Cognition. She believes education should be tailored to each student’s needs, creating a classroom where. curiosity thrives. By guiding undergraduate students in research skills and advanced inquiries, she aims to foster intellectual growth and prepare a new generation of researchers who can analyze concepts from multiple perspectives. Pranjali combines methodological rigor with innovative teaching strategies, breaking down complex topics into accessible units. Her interactive methods in language processing and brain-behavior relationships encourage students to connect theory with real-world applications, empowering them to tackle diverse research challenges confidently
