The study highlights the profound impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as #H2O2, and transient oxygenation on the carbon and Fe/S biogeochemistry in permeable intertidal sediments of the Wadden Sea. ROS plays a crucial role in influencing the rates of aerobic respiration, sulfate reduction, and hydrogen accumulation, consequently regulating the microbial mineralization processes.
