COVAT Study
Assistant Professor (SG)
COVAT study to the serological response of the Indian cohort in Uttarakhand
A COVID-19 serosurvey jointly funded by Genotypic Technology pvt limited and UPES R&D was conducted on May 3 and 4, 2023, at UPES campus to ensure that vaccines have effectively produced antibodies in the subjects. India was recording thousands of cases, and awareness of whether the vaccine had induced an antibody response would have made people decide whether to go for a booster. The vaccines are ineffective against all isolates, but they help reduce the viral load and severity of the disease.
