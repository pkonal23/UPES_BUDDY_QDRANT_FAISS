Social Impact
Every child deserves to reach her or his full potential. And education is one of the best predictors of success in children. It can help break the inter-generational cycles of poverty and marginalization. This project aims to provide the desired level of education in English and Mathematics to primary school students. It is helmed by the UPES faculty as mentors and supported by student volunteers.
