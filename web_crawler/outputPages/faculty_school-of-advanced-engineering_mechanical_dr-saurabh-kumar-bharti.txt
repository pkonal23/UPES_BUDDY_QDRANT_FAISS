In classroom, Dr. Saurabh â€˜s teaching philosophy is based on the better understanding of concept and create the interest among students to solve the engineering problems by using this. By giving real situation and variety of problems in the assignment helps students move from novice to expert thinking.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Saurabh discovered new types of Sommerfeld effects in rotor-dynamic systems as part of my research work. He applied his research results to test cases like asymmetric rotor shafts, truck suspension system with universal drives and torsional vibration resonances in z-configuration universal drive. Dr. Saurabh has considerable experience in multi-energy domain system modelling, multi-body dynamics, and proficient in simulation tools like Symbols, MATLAB -Sim Mechanics/Simscapes, MSC- ADAMS, etc. So far, Dr. Saurabh has seven research publications in reputed journals, all of which are SCI indexed and are in Q1 (top quartile). He also co-authored a book chapter and some conference articles and ability to solve problems in Applied Mechanics areas.
