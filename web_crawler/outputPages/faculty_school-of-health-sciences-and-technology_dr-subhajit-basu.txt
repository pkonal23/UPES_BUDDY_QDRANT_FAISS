Work Experience
Awards and Grants
Dr. Subhajit Basu is an environmental microbiologist with specialization in aquatic/marine microbiology and biogeochemistry. Subhajit’s research addresses complex microbial interactions from diverse and extreme environments, microbial ecophysiology, role in nutrient cycling and harnessing microbial metabolites for societal benefits. Following his Master’s in Microbiology from Bangalore University, Subhajit diversified into a highly interdisciplinary area of biological oceanography at the National Institute of Oceanography (CSIR-India), Goa. Here, he worked on prestigious international collaborative projects, such as the Indo-US collaborative project on ‘Climate Change Impacts on Ecosystem of the Arabian Sea’ and Space-Application Centre (ISRO) funded projects on oceanic harmful algal blooms. Subhajit earned his doctoral degree in Microbiology from Goa University (2014) for his work on the Microbial ecology of phytoplankton blooms of the Arabian Sea and their biogeochemical implications. Subhajit’s research has been published in front-line journals, and he has presented his work at numerous conferences – in India and abroad. As a field microbiologist with vast experience of ~15 years, Subhajit loves to explore diverse and extreme environments to study novel microbes. At UPES, Dehradun, Subhajit is working on microbial ecophysiology of unique high-altitude Himalayan ecosystems and presently guiding 4 PhD students.

Subhajit’s teaching philosophy is grounded in encouraging student learning through interactive classroom lessons and tutorials in order to integrate complicated concepts of planetary biogeochemistry with microorganisms as a central player and their importance in shaping our environment, climate, and health. He likes to present concepts in a simple, lucid language to encourage students to learn and ignite the passion of curiosity to explore the natural world. He loves to design thought experiments in classrooms in order to orient young undergraduates towards scientific research.

ASSEMBLE+ fellowship for research at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel (2022)
Subhajit’s research addresses how diverse microorganisms in their natural settings strive to obtain limiting nutrition, such as trace metals, impacts of microbial ecophysiology on elemental cycling, microbial remediation of pollutants, algal / plant-bacterial interactions, extremophiles and bioprospecting of novel microbial metabolites. Subhajit is adept at using sophisticated tracer assays (stable and radioisotopes), molecular techniques, advanced imaging, and omics to tease apart the functional complexity of microbial interactions.
