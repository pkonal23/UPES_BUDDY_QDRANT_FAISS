Research Interests
Dr. Prashant believes that it is his responsibility to create a learning environment that encourages and supports students. He uses a "flipped classroom" approach, where students read assigned sections from textbooks or other resources before class. In class, students take a short quiz based on what theyâ€™ve read. Instead of reviewing the quiz, it uses it as a foundation for activities where students work with real-world data and problems. This approach helps students move from basic to more advanced levels of understanding.
