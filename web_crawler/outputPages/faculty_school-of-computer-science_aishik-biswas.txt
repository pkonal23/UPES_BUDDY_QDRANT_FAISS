Research Interests
Professor Aishik Biswas’s teaching philosophy is centred on fostering a dynamic and interactive learning environment that encourages critical thinking and practical application. I believe in "flipping the classroom," where students engage with pre-reading assignments and quizzes before class, allowing in-class time to be dedicated to hands-on projects and real-world problem solving. This approach not only reinforces theoretical concepts but also helps students develop the skills necessary to tackle complex challenges in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. By creating a supportive and stimulating educational atmosphere, I aim to inspire students to reach their full potential and contribute innovatively to the field of computer science.
