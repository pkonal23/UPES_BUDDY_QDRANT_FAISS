Profile Summary
Assistant Professor
Dr Kumar has a great passion for teaching. He believes that teaching is a process of mutual learning; and this is especially so in a research environment where we explore the limits of knowledge. Research exclusive of teaching is likely to be far less fruitful â€“ this is true of undergraduate teaching as well as graduate teaching. At the undergraduate level, He would like to teach courses with an emphasis on Project-based Learning (PBL). These would help the students with hands-on experience, with a physical realization of abstract concepts learned in class. Also, such projects would foster a healthy model of working in groups and mutual learning. Further, I would encourage short write-ups and presentations to help the students develop their communication skills. With the objective of open dialogues, critical thinking, and research collaborations, he is always available for young and needy minds.
