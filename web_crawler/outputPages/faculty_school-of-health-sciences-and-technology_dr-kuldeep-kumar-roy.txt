A teacher or instructor lays seeds of knowledge that will develop indefinitely. As a teacher, he thinks each student is a unique seed that requires a stimulating atmosphere to develop, mature, and lead the future. His teaching philosophy may be summarised in four words: involvement, encouragement, exploration, and cross-learning. In his opinion, students learn best when actively involved in the learning process. A successful teaching method inspires students to think and discuss by educating them to question, analyze, and test newly acquired knowledge rather than accept it passively. As a teacher, he believes students should be provided with an active platform to learn, practice, and explore core information and abilities.
