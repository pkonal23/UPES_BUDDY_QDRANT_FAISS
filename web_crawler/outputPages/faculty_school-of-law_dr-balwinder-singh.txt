Dr. Balwinder Singh's teaching philosophy revolves around a few core principles, namely imparting and gaining knowledge, creating a learning environment, critical reflection, and professional growth (including values, commitments, and professional development). Teachers are more than technicians or purveyors of information. Accordingly, they must be committed to lifelong intellectual, personal, and professional growth.
