Dr. Ranjan's teaching philosophy is grounded in the understanding that it is his responsibility to create an ecosystem that supports and encourages student learning. He enjoys connecting stories with concepts and often corroborates them with examples. He challenges students to think critically in order to solve industry-related problems. He has incorporated elements of "flipping the classroom" into his teaching, such as pre-reading assignments where students read assigned sections of the textbook and/or other resources before coming to class, followed by a short quiz. The quiz material is not repeated in class but serves as the foundation for in-class assignments that involve students working with real data and situations. By using authentic problems, Dr. Ranjan helps students transition from novice to expert thinking.
Teaching Philosophy
Dr. Ranjan's research work has been accepted by several top institutions, such as the American Marketing Association (AMA), ANZMAC Australia, and ISB Hyderabad. He was nominated by IIM Indore and received a grant to attend a Teaching Workshop at IIM Bangalore.
