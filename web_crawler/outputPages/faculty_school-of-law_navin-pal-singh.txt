Mr. Navin's teaching philosophy is based on creating a learning and critical thinking environment for students. He believes that as an academician teaching law, it is essential to have a deep understanding of legal principles and concepts and the ability to effectively convey that knowledge to students. He also believes that as a law academician, the responsibility extends beyond imparting legal education to making students torchbearers in society, creating awareness about their legal rights and responsibilities.
