Industry Connect
Strengthening the already existing ten-year relationship, the IBM-UPES partnership has been renewed in 2022, to achieve a more impactful alliance. IBM will now be offering a first-of-its-kind industry-in-classroom model, where IBM subject matter experts provide learning directly to students, instead of the prevalent ‘train the teacher’ model.

Presently, IBM-UPES is the largest partnership of this nature in the world for IBM with over 2,000 enrolled students.
UPES was the first university to partner with IBM over a decade ago to co-brand 16 cutting-edge specialised programs through joint establishment with the Centre of Information Technology. UPES and IBM collaborated to launch a series of new, futuristic and industry-aligned Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) courses. Redesigned coursework and new delivery mechanisms enabled our students to learn industry-relevant skills. The courses focus on addressing the skill demand in various sectors, including Open-Source Software and Open Standards, with live industry-relevant projects for the students.

Under this re-energised partnership, IBM will also conduct minor projects and lead the capstone project for all students enrolling into the IBM-offered specialisations. The collaboration involves IBM conducting ICE (Innovation Centre for Education) week on campus, focusing on preparing students to excel in the latest technology and industry developments.
This partnership with IBM to co-brand 16 programs jointly with the Centre of Information Technology is the largest partnership of this nature for the company. The tie-up entails 30% face-to-face interactions between IBM experts and UPES students, project-based learning
