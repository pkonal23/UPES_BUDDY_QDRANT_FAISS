Let G be a finite group, and α: G x G → G denotes the commutator map. The cardinalities of the fiber α^{-1}(g) can be computed by a formula due to Frobenius, using the character values χ(g) of irreducible characters χ of G.
Uday Bhaskar Sharma delivered a presentation on "A Frobenius-Type Formula for Compact Lie Groups" at the conference ‘Groups and Representations’. The talk focused on deriving a generalised formula for connected compact Lie groups, orthogonal groups, and FC groups, in collaboration with Dr. Shripad Garge from IIT Bombay.
