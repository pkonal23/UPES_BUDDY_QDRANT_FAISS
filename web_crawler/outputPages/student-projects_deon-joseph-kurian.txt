Deon Joseph Kurian
Deon Joseph Kurian, a student pursuing the degree of B.Des. with the specialisation in Interior & Retail Space Design from the batch of 2018-22 completed the project of designing a novel retail concept for the nationwide expansion of The Indian Avatar, a thriving traditional clothing brand, encompassing over 50 stores across India.
The objective centred around crafting an exceptional shopping environment in alignment with the values of The Indian Avatar and Indian heritage, tailored to resonate with contemporary professional women. My contributions included conceptualizing fresh fixture collections and a retail approach that resonates with Indian women, offering a welcoming, relatable, and memorable shopping journey while upholding the brand's essence. This initiative sets the stage for future expansion and positive experiences.
