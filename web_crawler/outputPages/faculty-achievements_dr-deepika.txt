This research work introduces a hybrid fuzzy convolutional neural network (FCNN) based MFIF method, integrating FS with CNN for automatic features extraction and uncertainty removal in images. The proposed method generates data-driven decision maps using Siamese feature extraction module, achieving superior results over six benchmark methods in multi-focus image datasets with both qualitative and quantitative analysis.
