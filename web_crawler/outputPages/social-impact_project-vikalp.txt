Social Impact
Rural Women Technology Park has been involved in empowerment activities for the women of neighbouring villages surrounding the university campus since 2015. The project supports initiatives related to recycled paper products; ICT-assisted art and craft design; and identification and cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plant species. Additionally, these budding entrepreneurs receive assistance from experts on the campus for the marketing of their products.
