On the other hand, if you thrive in a structured environment and value the rich social and professional networking opportunities that come with a traditional college experience, then an on-campus B.Tech program could be a better fit. UPES’ on-campus programs offer hands-on learning opportunities through lab work, collaborative projects, and face-to-face interactions with professors and peers. The immersive environment allows you to develop technical skills and vital soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. Additionally, on-campus programs often provide direct access to industry experts, internships, and recruitment drives, making it easier to build your professional network and secure job opportunities early on.
On the other hand, on-campus students have access to university-provided resources, including computers, laboratories, and other infrastructure. While technology still plays a significant role in modern education, on-campus students do not need to rely as heavily on their personal devices for day-to-day learning.
