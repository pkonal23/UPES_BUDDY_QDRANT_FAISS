Akansha Rawat
Akansha bases her teaching philosophy on the idea that it is her duty to create an atmosphere that encourages and facilitates learning for her students. She incorporates elements of "flipping the classroom" into her classes, such as giving students pre-reading assignments to do before class, where they study particular passages from the textbook or other materials. Students take a quick quiz on the subject in class, and the results are used as the foundation for in-class activities that expose them to real-world facts and situations rather than being reviewed during lectures. Akansha assists students in moving from novice to expert-level thinking by utilizing real-world challenges.
