Hybrid Plasmonic Metasurfaces:
The project aims to overcome the limitations of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers in ballistic protection systems, such as low creep resistance, low melting temperature, and poor bonding with polymer matrices. The project enhances the thermal and mechanical properties of UHMWPE fibers and polyurethane resin by using surface-modified graphene oxide and a patented electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. These treated fibers will be integrated into hybrid laminated composite panels, tested for energy absorption under high-velocity impacts, and analysed for damage mechanisms. A 3D finite element model will guide the design of curved composite panels for personal and vehicle armor, combining experimental and numerical methods to develop lightweight ballistic armor with enhanced survivability.
