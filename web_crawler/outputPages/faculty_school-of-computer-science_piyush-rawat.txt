Profile Summary
Teaching is a highly stimulating experience for Dr. Rawat, and he is deeply passionate about it. He firmly believes that teaching is a mutual learning process, especially within a research environment where the boundaries of knowledge are explored. In his view, teaching involves articulating and elucidating concepts to learners, which serves as a compelling incentive for the teacher to have a clear understanding of those concepts. Through teaching, he develops appropriate abstractions of concepts to facilitate meaningful learning, and this process greatly enhances his own comprehension of the subject matter. These abstractions ultimately contribute to a better grasp of the body of knowledge, thereby supporting its expansion through research endeavours.
