Food start-up incubated at UPES seeks to empower local communities

I have been travelling in and outside India, either for work or for pleasure and photographing vigorously at the same time. However, I haven’t really been sharing them with a wider audience except for a few close friends and family members. All my photographs have been buried deep in hard drives and never really saw the light of the day. It was as if people didn’t really know me well. I had this urge to share my stories with the world. It was this urge, this feeling that led to publishing a selected bunch as a book.
One such project was my independent film on the lives of salt workers in the Little Rann of Kachchh. There are of course many more.

Additionally, my eldest sister has a talent for sewing and cooking, while another sister pursued Indian classical music for many years.

UI/UX is the flavour of the day, month and the year. UI/UX design has become increasingly important in recent years due to the growing importance of user-cantered design and the rise of mobile devices and apps. With the rise of digital products and services, there is a growing need for designers who can create user-friendly and engaging interfaces that meet the needs of users. No wonder I am seeing a monumental rise in student enrolment in Graphic an Interaction Design.

Communication Design is a creative process that involves expressing human experiences and ideas through various mediums such as print, digital, or interactive media. Inspiration for communication design can come from many different sources, including personal experiences, current events, cultural trends, and historical references.

As a kid, I was always tinkering with whatever I could get my hands on. I had an insatiable curiosity about how things functioned, how materials like clay behaved, and how the world appeared differently at different times of the day. The natural world held a particular fascination for me, with its varied colours, textures, smells, sounds, and tastes. In fact, my fondest childhood memories are from the time I spent in the backyard of our house, which holds a special place in my heart even today.

Technology has become an integral part of communication design, with designers using a range of digital tools and software to create designs. This has led to the development of new design techniques, such as interactive design and augmented reality.
The biggest change I would say is the shift towards digital. With the rise of the internet and social media, communication design has become increasingly focused on digital media. This has led to an increased emphasis on web design, social media graphics, and digital marketing campaigns and the likes.
As a communication designer, I believe that storytelling is a powerful tool for conveying complex ideas and engaging audiences. Using personal accounts and intimate stories can help to humanize a message, making it more relatable and memorable.

Achieving this level of independence has taken a lot of hard work and perseverance. There have been times when I have faced challenges or setbacks, but I have always stayed focused on my goals and remained true to my values.

My biggest inspiration for communication design comes from the people around me. I am always observing and listening to people, their stories, and experiences, which inform my creative process. Human behaviour, emotions, and interactions with the world around them provide a rich source of inspiration and ideas for communication design projects.

Communication design industry has become increasingly global, with designers working with clients and audiences from all over the world. This has led to an increased focus on cultural sensitivity and localization in design.
For me, the biggest challenge was also achieving financial independence as a designer. It took a lot of hard work and determination, but once I achieved that, I was able to pursue projects that aligned with my interests and values. Being financially independent gave me the freedom to take on projects that I truly believed in, rather than just taking on any project that came my way. It allowed me to focus on the work that I was passionate about and create designs that had a meaningful impact.
