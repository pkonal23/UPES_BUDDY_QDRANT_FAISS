Social Impact
Aligned with the objectives of Swachh Bharat Mission to clean up streets, roads and public spaces in the cities, towns, urban and rural areas, Project Swachhta has evoked a sense of responsibility among the residents of Dehradun too. Cleanliness drives are being conducted at regular interval in areas adjoining the campus. The local residents have also been sensitized to join the program. The aim is to instill the value of cleanliness among youth through voluntary work in order to take the cleanliness drive to the next level.
