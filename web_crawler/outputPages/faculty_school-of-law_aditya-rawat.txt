My teaching philosophy is antithetical to the guru-shishya hierarchical model and is not premised on a product-knowledge paradigm. It is more of a process wherein I am as much a learner as I am learned. As a legal educator, it becomes imperative that we partake in discourses before asking the 'law questions'.
