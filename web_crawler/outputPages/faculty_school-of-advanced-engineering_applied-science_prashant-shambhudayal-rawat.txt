Applied Sciences
Dr. Prashant S Rawat's research interests revolve around experimental atomic, molecular, and optical Physics (AMOP) with a specific focus on both electron and photon interactions with matter. His areas of expertise include intense radiation-matter interactions in gas phases using petawatt and femtosecond lasers, as well as electron interactions with atoms and molecules at low (0 â€“ 20 eV) and intermediate (up to 1 KeV) energies. To explore these interests, he employs spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy as fundamental tools. Recently, his research has also encompassed safety studies related to nuclear instrumentation and installations.
