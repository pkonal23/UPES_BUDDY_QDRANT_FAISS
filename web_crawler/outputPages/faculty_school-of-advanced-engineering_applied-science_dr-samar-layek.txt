Research Interests
Dr. Layek firmly believes in an active learning process where learners actively reconstruct knowledge in their minds. As a teacher, his primary role is to create conducive conditions for effective learning, often achieved through engaging students with tabletop experiments and fostering an active classroom environment. He emphasizes organizing course material around fundamental ideas, encouraging deep understanding. Dr. Layek also designs exam problems that require both qualitative and quantitative analysis of physical phenomena, avoiding overly simplistic approaches like "equation hunting."
