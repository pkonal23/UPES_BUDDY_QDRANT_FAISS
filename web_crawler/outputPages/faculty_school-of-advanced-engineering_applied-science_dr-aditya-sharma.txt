Research Interests
His research investigations extend to Swift-heavy-ion and ion-implantation, particularly studying the effects of ion-irradiation on the structural, optical, magnetic and electrical properties of various oxide materials (HfO2, SrVO3, SnO2, CuO, Cu2O etc.), thereby advancing understanding of the interesting phenomenon of ion-solid interaction.
"In learning, one will teach, and in teaching, one will learn," states the belief of the individual. He perceives teaching as the art of conveying knowledge, offering their perspective on the topic with clarity and a well-defined understanding. Creating an inclusive class environment is their foremost objective, aiming to establish a friendly atmosphere conducive to open communication and discussion. He emphasizes practical knowledge and real-life examples to make a lasting impression on students' minds, and for theoretical topics, they prefer to draw from the works of multiple authors. Their primary goal as a teacher is not merely to impart bookish knowledge but to develop students' critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. He emphasizes the importance of research and science, instilling in students a sense of responsibility towards society. This philosophy guides their approach to teaching and research.
