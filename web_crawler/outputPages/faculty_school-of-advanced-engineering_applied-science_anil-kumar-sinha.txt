Professor Sinha is recognized as one of India's leading experts in the design, development, and utilization of synchrotron beamlines. The beamlines (National Facility), developed by him on Indian synchrotron sources Indus 1 and Indus 2, have been utilized by academia and industries for cutting-edge scientific research for more than a decade. Currently, Professor Sinha's research interests include electrode materials for sodium and lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen production, storage, and sensing, as well as materials synthesis and characterization. He has an impressive publication record, with more than 250 publications in refereed journals. At UPES, Professor Sinha has successfully set up coin cell fabrication and characterization facilities. Additionally, he also oversees the Central Instrumentation Centre (CIC) at UPES and manages operations and facilitates the creation of novel experimental setups.

Profile Summary
School of Advanced Engineering
Professor Sinha's teaching philosophy centres on the understanding that it is the teacher's responsibility to generate student interest in the course and foster overall learning. He incorporates two essential elements into his courses â€“ 1) Providing reasonable details of the course prerequisites before starting the assigned course and 2) Relating the syllabus to real-life problems. By employing this, he creates an atmosphere that encourages learning in Mathematical Physics courses. He believes in a balanced teaching pace which helps in extracting the best from the students.
