One of the most remarkable aspects of my MBA program at Berkeley Haas was the incredible diversity within our class. Representing all seven continents of the world, my classmates brought unique perspectives, experiences, and insights from their respective regions. The exposure to such diverse backgrounds expanded my understanding of global business and broadened my horizons. Collaborating with individuals from different cultures not only enriched our classroom discussions but also fostered a deeper appreciation for the global interconnectedness of our world.

It has been an incredible journey so far, pursuing my MBA in Oil and Gas Management at UPES Dehradun. Thanks to the university’s Study Abroad program, I lived my dream at UC Berkeley, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world. Berkeley Haas Global Access Program (BHGAP) has opened doors to an immersive learning experience, exposing me to diverse cultures, groundbreaking ideas, and a global network of students. I spent a whole semester approximating 6 months, studying BHGAP in Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
Software engineer and developer are two interrelated terms and many people would think there is no difference between the two.
