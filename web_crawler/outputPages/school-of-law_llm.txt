The primary focus of energy law is to ensure that energy is supplied at an affordable price without disruption. The primary focus of environmental laws is to ensure that the process of creating anything, including energy, does not create "too much" pollution. Considering how energy is created and the critical and pressing question of climate change, energy law must become more integrated with environmental law. Indeed, we need to reimagine energy policy to draw on much of the best thinking in both energy law and environmental law circles and create an integrated energy and environmental law. In this specialisation, students delve into legal questions of energy and environment law in an integrated and comprehensive manner.
