Eligibility Criteria
Teaching is a very prestigious and responsible profession, and a teacher is a responsible path director for the proper guidance to the students who have faith in the teacher and building the nation indirectly. Being a teacher, I could be a link between knowledge and student and make students learn quickly through my guidance, proper explanation, and demonstration by audio-visual aids and performance in the laboratories. At the same time, the teacher must be a good learner, as learning is a lifelong process. He believes one of the most precious and invaluable feelings is to hear that students achieve their goals successfully and that teachers contribute a little behind the curtains. Authenticity is essential for him as a teacher. He considers being true to himself in every aspect essential, so he also ensures that every bit of information given to students is true to his best knowledge. Sincerity, honesty, hard work, ethical practice, and faithfulness to my teaching profession will be the “Mantras” he does believe in and follow for my teaching professional career.
