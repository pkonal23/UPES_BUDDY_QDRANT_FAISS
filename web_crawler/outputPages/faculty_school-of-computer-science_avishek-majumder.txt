My teaching philosophy focuses on fostering curiosity by encouraging engaging and thought-provoking discussions. I believe in creating an environment where students are challenged to question assumptions, explore new perspectives, and cultivate an inquisitive mindset. By fostering this approach, I aim to inspire a passion for lifelong learning. My ultimate goal is to empower students to think independently, critically analyze information, and apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.
