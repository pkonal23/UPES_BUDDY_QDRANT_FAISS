Dr. Wadhwa is currently leading a collaborative UGC-DAE CSR project, investigating the properties of palladium-based composites for hydrogen sensing and storage applications. She has been a part of the prestigious DST-UKIERI Project, a collaborative project between India and the UK, and has collaborated with esteemed institutions worldwide. She is also actively guiding 3 Ph.D. scholars and has a remarkable record of attending 30 National and International conferences in India and abroad. She has delivered around 15 invited talks and her prolific research contributions include 52 research articles with a total impact factor of 235, h-index of 17, i10-index of 26, over 900 citations, 9 book chapters, and 2 complete Indian patents. Dr. Wadhwa is a lifetime member of esteemed professional societies such as the Royal Society of Chemistry (MRSC), the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), and the Northern Ireland Biomedical Engineering Society (NIBES).
Research Interests
Dr. Wadhwa firmly believes in creating a supportive and encouraging environment to facilitate student learning. She actively inspires students through various teaching methods such as the 'Flipped Classroom' method of teaching. It is an educational approach in which the traditional roles of in-class instruction and homework are reversed or "flipped." In this model, students are exposed to instructional content, such as lectures or readings, outside of the classroom, typically through digital resources like videos or online materials. Class time is then dedicated to interactive activities, discussions, problem-solving, and other engaging exercises that allow students to apply and deepen their understanding of the material. The aim of the flipped classroom is to enhance active learning, encourage critical thinking, and provide more personalized interactions between teachers and students during face-to-face sessions.
