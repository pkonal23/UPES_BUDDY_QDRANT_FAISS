Dr. Naik's research interests encompass various aspects,  Active Fault Mapping and Paleoseismic Investigations and earthquake hazard estimation for different regions from different tectonic environments ( intraplate, volcanic and plate boundary regions). One of his major thrust research is application of Geophysical tools (ERT, GPR< Seismci Downhole, MASW) for Investigations for shallow subsurface geophysical investigation. He is interested in Soil Liquefaction Potential evaluation (both experimental and analytical) and its mitigation using different sustainable material such as activated carbon.
