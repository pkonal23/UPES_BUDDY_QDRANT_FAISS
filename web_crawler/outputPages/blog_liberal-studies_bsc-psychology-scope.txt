Imagine sitting in a café, watching people around you. One person is quietly reading a book, while another is animatedly chatting with a friend. At the counter, a barista moves swiftly, preparing drinks, seemingly in sync with the rhythms of the bustling café. Now, consider how fascinating it would be to truly understand what’s going on inside each of their minds. This is where psychology steps in—a field dedicated to uncovering the mysteries of human thought, emotion, and behavior.

Stories are an age-old way of imparting information and education across the world. Storytelling is an important and effective tool in the interview process.
This is where psychology comes into play—it’s the science of understanding what makes each person tick. For example, your cousin’s outgoing nature might be due to their extroverted personality, which psychology helps us understand as a blend of genetics and life experiences. Your aunt’s quiet demeanor could be linked to a tendency toward introversion, showing how people can feel energized by different kinds of social interactions. And your niece? She might be in the early stages of cognitive development, a fascinating phase where children begin to explore and make sense of the world around them.
