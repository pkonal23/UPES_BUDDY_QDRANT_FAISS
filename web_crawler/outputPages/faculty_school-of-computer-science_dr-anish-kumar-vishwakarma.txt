Research Interests
Assistant Professor-Senior Scale
He has completed his Ph.D. from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India. He created several statistical and machine learning-based models for no-reference video quality assessment. During his PostDoc at IIT Madras, he worked towards advanced analytics for combat sports using deep learning at the Centre of Excellence for Sports Analytics. His research is aimed at expanding the use of ML-based techniques for other image and video applications. The use of data science, machine learning, and deep learning in computer vision and other interdisciplinary fields is particularly appealing to him.
He received the best paper award at the International Conference on the Paradigm Shifts in Communication, Embedded Systems, Machine Learning, and Signal Processing (PCEMS 2022). He also received the best paper award at the International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Grid Computing (PDGC 2020).
