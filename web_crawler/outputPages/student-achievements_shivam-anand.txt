The interior design prioritizes human comfort and environmental sustainability, incorporating materials such as 80% ocean-reprocessed plastic, Casein, microfiber, and carbon fibre for strength and lightweight construction. Notable features include built-in amenities like regional temperature control, a wireless charging activation system, adjustable hand rests, and integrated medical emergency services.
The recognition was earned for the conceptual design model of MOT-IoN Autonomous self-driven vehicles. MOT-IoN vehicles pioneer a live environment reaction system that humanizes the vehicle's behaviour, making it noticeable and reactive to pedestrians on the road. This innovation contributes to reducing contact between pedestrians and the vehicle by eliminating decision-making confusion, especially when crossing roads.
