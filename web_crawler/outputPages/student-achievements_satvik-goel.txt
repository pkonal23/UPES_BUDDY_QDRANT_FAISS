The concept of "Mazing Puzzle" was spurred by my observation of an unmet need in the toy marketâ€”a lack of products that facilitate cognitive and social development in young children. Driven by my deep-rooted passion for crafting items that are not only enjoyable but also educational, I embarked on a journey to develop a toy that could seamlessly merge these two key aspects.
