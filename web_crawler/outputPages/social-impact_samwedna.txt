Eligibility Criteria
Construction projects are a tall order and usually require people with varied skill sets to execute it. Workers are typically hired to spend months or even years on any one project. At our campus, too, there are numerous construction projects, thus making it a transit home for hundreds of workers. This project is aimed at the children of these workers. It provides them with education, day-care, mid-day meals, medical checkups, clothing, etc., through a day school set-up at the campuses.
