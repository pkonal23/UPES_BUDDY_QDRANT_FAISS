Faculty Achievements
Microwave communication engineering:
The aim of this project is to develop infrastructure in two areas:
The aim is to establish a high-speed line-of-sight microwave telecommunications facility between the UPES Bidholi and Kandoli campuses. This facility will enable in-depth investigation of multiple research questions related to communications, networking, and weather effects in mountainous areas within the flagship projects. The goal is to advance strategic engineering applications through comprehensive investigations of various scenarios.
: The aim is to set up a battery design, manufacturing, and testing facility to realize, operate and maintain the health of battery packs (using different technologies) for the multitude of systems expected to be realized in various flagship projects.
