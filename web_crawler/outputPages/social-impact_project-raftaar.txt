Social Impact
While academics play a significant role, extra-curricular activities are also important in shaping the personality and character of a student. Children who dabble in these activities are known to display a heightened sense of discipline, concentration, and time-management. Project Raftaar aims at personality development of students in eight government primary schools through sports and cultural activities. An annual inter-school competition with over 300 participants, the event provides the students a platform to compete amongst themselves.
