Social Internship - Srijan
Satvik Srivastava
UPES has created avenues for our alumni to upskill by enrolling for various courses in Deep Tech, the Metaverse, Digital Transformation, and Leadership at four locations in India ‚Äì Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Dehradun.
UPES is one of the few universities in India that offer social internships in the first year to all students, irrespective of their field of study. While UPES has conducted social internships in the past, what makes Srijan unique is that it is a mandatory six-week-long social internship. It firmly puts the ‚Äòsocial‚Äô at the centre of learning for university students. It drives home the point that the core purpose of education is to better the lives of others and the community as a whole. Social internships introduce students to the society and its challenges and create value systems of service, giving, empathy and respect for those who are less fortunate.
Placed at Accenture
The university boasts of a robust and successful career services department. Its partnerships with industries ensure that the students have adequate exposure and get rapidly absorbed into professional roles upon completion of their studies. At UPES, the focus is on developing a world-class pool of young and talented professionals who are ready to hit the ground running in their respective fields. The learning environment and practical hands-on approach help students forge ahead on their chosen career paths with a positive attitude, the right skill set and practical know-how. Because of the relevant and ‚Äòreal world‚Äô education and ‚Äòon-the-job‚Äô exposure, the industry-readiness of UPES students has been one of the key differentiators.
