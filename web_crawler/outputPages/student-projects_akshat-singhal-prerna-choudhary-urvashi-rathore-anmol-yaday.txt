Breast Cancer Classification using Deep Learning
Breast cancer is a rapidly advancing disease that, when identified in its early stages, becomes treatable. Instances have shown that timely detection leads to prompt treatment, resulting in reduced mortality rates. Research endeavors in the domain of breast cancer focus on early detection and effective treatment strategies.
Among these advancements, deep learning stands out as a transformative technique. Deep learning mitigates limitations inherent to machine learning approaches. Techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) are cornerstones of deep learning within data science.
