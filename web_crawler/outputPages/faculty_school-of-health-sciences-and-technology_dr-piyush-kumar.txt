Dr. Piyush considers learning more than reading and understanding the assigned topic and being able to repeat it. Students will likely need help identifying the key concepts or carefully examining their prior knowledge. So, a teacher should act as a facilitator to identify such key concepts and can lead the initial discussion. One such essential aspect of the successful discussion is letting the students ask more questions. During his interactive discussions with students, He make literature learning enjoyable through use of models, learning by mistakes, PowerPoint presentations and animated videos to explain the concept more effectively that leads a long-lasting memory in students. He believes a teacher should ask exploratory questions that lead students to examine their prior knowledge, rephrase questions, direct the discussion to develop concepts, relate the problems surrounding them, and find out the possible solution(s) with new or already developed technologies in science. Moreover, above all, his prime concern is ensuring that everyone in the class participates and learns the material.
