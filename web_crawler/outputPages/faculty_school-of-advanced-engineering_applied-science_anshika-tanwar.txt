Research Interests
Ms Anshika is passionate about teaching and to inculcate the mathematical thinking in students. Her teaching philosophy includes motivating the students to learn and gain fundamental knowledge of the subject matter. She focuses her classroom teaching on this principle of student engagement and interaction. She believes that every student has the potential of their own and teachers are a guide for their students to find their full potential.

Anshika Tanwar
Faculty
Ms Anshika has core research experience in Applied Mathematics. Her research field is Fracture Mechanics where she has worked on problems using the principles of thermo-elasticity and solid mechanics. She has worked on problems related to cracks mechanics under the impact of thermal and mechanical loadings in orthotropic composite materials. Till now, she has done semi-analytical analysis of physical parameters like stress intensity factors, heat flux intensity, crack opening displacements, crack energy etc using the mathematical concepts of integral equations, partial differential equations, integral transforms viz, Fourier transform, Laplace transform. She has published research articles in this field related to problems involving thermo-elasticity in orthotropic materials.
Ms. Anshika has during her PhD, worked actively as a teaching assistant and tutor for several B. Tech courses in IIT (BHU). This includes Real Analysis, Probability and Statistics, Mathematical Methods. She has joined the School of Advanced Engineering, UPES from September 2024.
Presentation paper titled "Partially insulated cracks under thermo-mechanical loadings" in MSADE-2024 held in IIT-Ropar from 26 Feb-02 March 2024.
