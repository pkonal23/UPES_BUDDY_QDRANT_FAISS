Dr. Girish Kothyari's exceptional contributions in the field of geosciences have been recognized through a series of prestigious awards and grants. He was bestowed the National Geoscience Award (NGA) in 2017 by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, for his achievements in Applied Geosciences. In 2022, he was honored with the ISES Award for Senior Scientist in Seismotectonic and Applied Seismology, presented by the ISES president. Dr. Kothyari's impact extends globally, as he was featured in the world ranking of top 2% scientists in both 2021 and 2022, a distinction published by Stanford University. His consistent dedication to excellence is further evident through accolades such as the Best Poster Presentation Award in Advances in Earthquake Sciences (AES) in 2014, the Best Presentation Honor at the Indo-US Conference on Intraplate Seismicity in 2012, and the Fast-Track Young Scientist Award from the Department of Science and Technology in 2011. These honours underscore Dr. Kothyari's commitment to advancing geoscience knowledge and his remarkable contributions to the field.
Dr. Girish Chandra Kothyari is a globally well-recognized scientist and a leading expert in Active tectonics and Tectonic geomorphology. He boasts nearly 18 years of research experience in the field of disaster studies caused by earthquakes, landslides, flash floods, etc. His studies also encompass active tectonics, paleoseismology, tectonic geomorphology, and Satellite geodesy (InSAR) studies for identifying locations of active deformation, with a current focus on two active domains in Indiaâ€”the Himalayas and Kachchh Peninsula.
