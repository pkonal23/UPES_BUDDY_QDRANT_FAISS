The fairy-tale doesn’t stop here. This AI-powered software is a wizard at math, and if you can clearly state the problem, it can solve the most challenging algebra puzzles. If you are trying to debug your erroneous language code, it will tell you where you missed the comma in the coding. Give it a few pointers and it will write an essay on any subject, no matter how challenging it might be and if you have written one yourself it will grade it for you too! Tell ChatGPT what limited ingredients you have in your pantry, and it will give you a list of delectable dishes you could cook up with them, and also provide their recipes. It can create music, translate your content into native languages and if you are lonely, you can use it to chat up, though you never know where that tête-à-tête might take you!

ChatGPT is based on information from the Internet, which may contain biases of the writers, and it picks those biases too, since it cannot judge between what is `ethically’ right and wrong. Its responses may then have racial, gender, socio economic prejudices.
If you are tech savy and want to have a deeper understanding of tech world the BCA is just the degree for you.

In creating the text, ChatGPT commits the plagiarism, but since a non-human cannot be held responsible, it exposes the writer to the risk of potential litigation. This deems it necessary to review the write-up, which then doubles the work.

“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” ― Martin Fowler.
When writing assignments, such as essays or articles, it has the ability to pick what it needs and present a well mashed, superbly presented piece of work. But it’s hard to determine the source of the information, as it doesn’t provide references. It’s `human co-author’ will still need to search through the Internet to determine where the system picked the information from and provide due credits to avoid copyright issues.
Course Type
The use of ChatGPT in education poses a huge threat: Students are likely to become overly dependent on technology to solve their problems, answer questions or write their essays, leading to a weakening in critical thinking and problem-solving skills and degrade students’ learning and creativity in the long run.

To err is human, and since humans have given birth to AI, we cannot expect it to be error-free either. This actuality exposes us to the big bad world of legal and ethical dilemma concerning its use. The buzz is on; but some notables, including `The Ethicalist’, a digital-first sustainable lifestyle magazine, have tried to converse with the software itself about what it can and cannot do. What follows is some potent inferences and a summary of confessions, directly from the horse’s mouth:

The software is reasonably efficient for writing work, but it is far from competent in many areas, such as creating rocket equations or in a medical advisory capacity. You might be creating a potentially catastrophic situation if you bypass the human expertise and rely on AI for these matters.

The system is designed to say things that are plausible, but they may not be correct, and then accuracy of the content it generates is an issue. According to Emily M. Bender, a professor of linguistics at the University of Washington who studies AI systems, “It gets things wrong, because it’s not actually designed to get things right.”

The world of technology is rapidly evolving, and the demand for skilled computer science engineers is higher than ever.

The image processing industry has been growing at a steady pace, with rising demand from industries such as healthcare, military, agriculture, and the environment, among others. As an image processing engineer, your options are limitless
But within 2 weeks, a data breach which partly exposed conversations and some users’ personal details including email addresses and the last four digits of their credit cards brought the entire euphoria around ChatGPT crashing down. Italy’s privacy watchdog, The Italian Data Protection Authority, has temporarily banned it, describing the move as a provisional measure “until ChatGPT respects privacy”. More than 1,000 artificial intelligence experts and researchers, including Elon Musk, co-founder OpenAI, Steve Woznaik the co-founder of Apple, engineers from Google, Meta, Microsoft, and academicians too have joined a call for “an immediate pause on the creation of giant AIs for at least six months, so the capabilities and dangers of systems such as GPT-4 can be properly studied and mitigated”. In an open letter, they stated clearly, “Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.” That’s quite an honest admission coming from the minds behind these robots themselves.
As a Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student, your final year project is not just a mandatory academic requirement—it's a golden opportunity to showcase your skills, creativity, and readiness for the tech industry.

UPES was an associate sponsor of the Pune Design Festival, 2022. One of the workshops at the festival ‘Into the Metaverse – AR/VR’ was presented by UPES faculty Dr. Anmol Srivastava and Pankaj Badoni, who gave engaging insights about the early stages of Metaverse.
To preserve natural resources for future generations and to minimise their negative effects on the environment, conservation refers to the ethical management and sustainable use of these resources.
In recent years, the field of AI has shown impressive progress and innovation, affecting our everyday lives in unprecedented ways.
Decision-making is a ubiquitous and indispensable aspect of responsible human life.  Decisions must be made at individual and at institutional levels.

The system can be hacked and used to spread malware to user devices. Data theft is possible if it does not properly protect customer records using methods like encryption and this could also encourage online fraud.
The software is based on information up to 2021; what it turns out might already be outdated and irrelevant stuff.
Dr. Ravi S. Iyer
Ask it to prepare a legal document, it might well be able to as it has access to all the information in the world, but it hasn’t studied law and cannot interpret what the law would permit in a given situation, and what you may be left with at hand is just a mass of well-written, but totally unusable paperwork.
The ethical dilemma on ChatGPT
Choosing the right degree is one of the most critical decisions you'll make when planning your tech career. In the field of computer science, two of the most popular undergraduate courses are the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) and the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Computer Science.

We live in the digital era, and new technologies that enable the automation of processes are rapidly coming up. ChatGPT and other such tools will without doubt make technical work easier, efficient and faster but we need to be cognizant of the fact that technologies like this cannot replace human creativity. Also, they are still in their infancy, and there are already plenty of ethical issues to take into account with its use. Technological advancements are great as long as there’s responsible use of technology, hence, like all AI, ChatGPT too need to be regulated, but it might take a while for governments to put meaningful regulation into action. Till then, humans need to hold on to their position; else an unconstrained reign of the robots is imminent.
ChatGPT (GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer), developed by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence firm, with initial funding from Elon Musk, is a program that can realistically write like a human. It has created quite a sensation since its launch in November 2022 and within the first two months of its unveiling, it has had more than 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application. In March 2023, OpenAI launched the GPT-4 technology in the ChatGPT Plus Plan that has the ability to generate more than 25,000 words in 26 languages! Microsoft announced plans to invest 10 billion dollars in it and to integrate it into its Windows, Edge, and Office applications in the very near future. That was one impressive start!
