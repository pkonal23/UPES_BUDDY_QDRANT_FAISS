Dr. Aprajita Singh celebrates the individuality and distinctive contributions of each student in the classroom. As a teaching method, she encourages her students to pay attention to and reflect on certain areas of their practice. If they come to a conclusion or have an initial emotional response related to the discipline, she urges them to write about it. This approach brings individual responses, differences, and opinions to the forefront, fostering an appreciation for each other's perspectives and facilitating democratic interactions. This problem-solving pedagogy aligns with the law's role in resolving certain issues, and the case study method is particularly relevant as it closely resembles problem-solving approaches.
