I spent almost 2 years at UPES (as Industry Fellow) teaching variety of Upstream courses related to Petroleum Engineering. I was also Faculty Advisor for UPES SPE SC in 2017-2018. I was also pursuing my PhD at UPES but had to give it up in 2018, when my previous company called me back to help them with Startup in Norway. During my time at UPES, I learnt about Academic processes, NBA, PhD, but teaching younger generation was most satisfying. Many of my past students at UPES are still in touch with me either directly thru Whatsapp or thru LinkedIn
