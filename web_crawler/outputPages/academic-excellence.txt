UPES has been bringing professionals from various industries into the classroom to share their insights, experiences, and knowledge with students. This approach aims to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application, providing students with a deeper understanding of how concepts are applied in real business or industry contexts.

At the UPES School of Law, one of the important elements is to focus on clinical legal education, which emphasises the practical skills of research, court craft, advocacy, counselling, negotiations, and legal drafting. Understanding the market practices and the commercial aspects of transactions differentiates a regular lawyer from a sought-after one.

The Bar Council of India and the UGC recognise the importance of involving practising advocates and professionals in the teaching and learning process of law schools. To this end, UPES School of Law has a policy on the appointment of Professors of Practice (PoPs), which essentially is an engagement of senior practising advocates and eminent legal professionals. This aligns with international best practices followed by several top foreign universities and law schools.
