Dr. Nelson believes that by birth, nature had made every person a teacher and a learner. Learning is endless and can be derived from many sources â€“ be it seniors, juniors, or even students and children. On a few occasions, even mistakes and wrong decisions teach new lessons. The learning process is better when knowledge is taught or shared with young smarter minds. He considers teaching as a noble responsibility of enlightening the learners while being virtuous and adhering to principles and standards of right conduct and ethics, other than technical expertise. Dr. Nelson has always considered teaching as a noble profession and the zeal to work hard as his talent.
