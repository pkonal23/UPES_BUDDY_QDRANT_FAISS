Awards and Grants
Dr. Bhandari welcomed Dr. Tristan Partridge from the University of California, Santa Barbara (USA) as a visiting researcher at UPES for a joint study. He was invited by the Human Rights Law Network (HRLN), New Delhi, to speak on the Beej Bachao Andolan in 2008. Dr. Bhandari has voluntarily dedicated his time to educate foreign students about the Chipko Movement, Beej Bachao Movement, and other social movements and reforms in the Garhwal Himalayan regions. He co-authored an article with Dr. Tristan Partridge for a well-known magazine on the history and origins of the Chipko Movement. Additionally, he also co-authored two magazine pieces on the Chipko movement and environmental issues with Dr. Tristan Partridge from the University of California and Mr. Bharat Dogra, a freelance writer. Dr. Bhandari actively participated in the Aarakot-Askot foot march to collect traditional seeds of paddies in Uttarakhand. Furthermore, he delivered an invited lecture on "Advanced Computational Techniques in Science and Engineering" at NIT Uttarakhand.
