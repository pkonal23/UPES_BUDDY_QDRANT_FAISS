The primary focus of Dr. Pathak's research has been on the investigation and development of nano-sized ultra-thin magnetic and spin systems. These nano-sized ultra-thin magnetic and spin systems include magnetic superlattices, MTJs, and ferromagnetic nanomaterials. In 2017, he made a significant contribution to developing high-density patterns by ion-induced phase transformation. Using low-energy proton irradiation and non-destructive interface control, he showed that magnetic patterns with a pattern size of ~8 nm may be generated in complex magnetic nanostructures (Applied Physics Letters, 111, 152401). His recent article (Advanced Science, 9, 2201749 (2022)) shows the unique pseudomorph interfacial structure of Co/Pd constructed by phase‐transformation of paramagnetic Co3O4/Pd to ferromagnetic Co/Pd superlattices by low‐energy proton irradiation making it possible to induce extraordinarily large orbital anisotropy and strongly enhance spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the interface, which can be attributed to the strong level of structural inversion asymmetry (SIA) and the substantial in-plane tensile stress built up at the interface between Co and Pd. He also proposed a quick, affordable, and reliable in-house method based on micromagnetic modelling to estimate the characteristics of MTJs in 2017 (Applied Physics Letters, 110, 232401) and 2020 (Nature Scientific Reports, 10, 2799) in response to the challenges of tunnel junction fabrication. He has all-around expertise in growth, characterization of magnetic thin films, and nanostructure along with transport measurements. His capability to develop and measure scientific instruments such as the MOKE microscope/magnetometer (Journal of Applied Physics 115, 043906 (2014)) make him an asset to the organization.
Dr. Pathak places a strong emphasis on nurturing student curiosity and critical thinking to inspire a passion for learning physics and materials science. He is dedicated to creating an open and friendly classroom environment that welcomes all students and encourages learning through discussions and exploration. By incorporating relevant real-world examples and interdisciplinary connections, he aims to instill in his students a lifelong interest in the subject matter and equip them with problem-solving abilities crucial for success in higher education and the workforce. Through personalized instruction and continuous feedback, Dr. Pathak hopes his students will become self-directed learners and enthusiastic explorers of the fascinating fields of physics and materials science.
