This attainment signifies the recognition and protection of the "Intelligent Border Surveillance" Software under the Government of India's copyright. The software's mission is to create an advanced algorithm utilizing Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multi-Agent Modelling to enhance the efficiency of border force patrol procedures. Grid systems are employed to partition the map, and route layout algorithms are implemented to optimize patrolling strategies. This achievement represents a significant step forward in strengthening border security and surveillance measures.
