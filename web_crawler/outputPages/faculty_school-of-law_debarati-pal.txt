Research Interests
Subsequently, I enrolled as a doctoral student at NALSAR, Hyderabad, under the guidance of Dr. Aruna Venkat, with a focus on the interface of heritage protection and law. After thorough analysis, the title of my research stands as 'Critical Reflections on the Revitalisation of Historic Urban Landscapes: Exploring the Stakeholder Interface.' My recent publication titled "A Trans-Boundary Legislative Impact Assessment of the Kailash Sacred Landscapes: Interpreting Legal Adaptation Through the Cross-Stakeholder Interface" has been published by McGill University, Montreal, and can be found at

My research journey began as a Project Scholar at the Rajiv Gandhi School of IP Laws, IIT Kharagpur, in 2014, under the MHRD Project - Policy Planning, Legal Assessment, and Governance of Smart Cities, under the supervision of Dr. Indrajit Dube. In this project, I catalogued various legislations related to land use planning, building, and heritage legislations, mapping their institutional interactions and interventions as part of the project's objectives and deliverables. Intrigued by the teleological aspect of land and landscapes, I started exploring the nuances of heritage, historicity, authenticity, and integrity of buildings and precincts.

Assistant Professor (SS)
School of Law
Throughout my teaching, I have encouraged inclusive participation in classroom discussions by inviting speculations, explanations, and raising doubts. I have also emphasized experiential learning through internships and boot camps, enabling students to apply problem-based learning. Students have shared their experiences in client management strategies, civil and criminal trials, blending them with realist school of thought.
Typically, a class cohort consists of approximately 60 students, ranging from A to C level students based on their ability, motivation, and previous schooling background. The subjects I have taught over the years include Legal Methods, Jurisprudence, Interpretation of Statutes, and Transfer of Property Act. The knowledge-building exercises vary from whiteboard teaching to PowerPoint presentations and sometimes mock debate sessions. Assessments provide a certain degree of freedom for faculty members to customize, considering the strengths and weaknesses of the cohort. Assessments include quizzes, case comments, and analysis of theories related to the course.

I take pleasure in introducing myself as an Assistant Professor of Law associated with the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies since 2016. Additionally, I am a doctoral student pursuing my research on 'Critical Reflections on the Revitalisation of Historic Urban Landscapes: Exploring the Stakeholder Interface' at NALSAR, Hyderabad. Previously, I was associated with Rajiv Gandhi School of IP Law, IIT Kharagpur, as a Project Fellow working on the MHRD project "Future of Cities."
During my tenure at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies since 2016, I have witnessed a transformation in pedagogical techniques over the years. We have transitioned from individual customized course plans to a more formalized common course plan, along with common question papers for mid-semester and end-semester examinations. This shift has fostered constructivism in learning and alignment in the design of teaching and assessment. The intended learning outcomes are mapped with the course topics, modules, and sub-modules.
