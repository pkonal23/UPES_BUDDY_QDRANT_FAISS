Dr. Pachauriâ€™s teaching philosophy is grounded in the understanding that it is his responsibility to create a climate that supports and encourages student learning. He is dedicated to teaching and research with enthusiasm and commitment so that engineering students can spark their curiosity, accept the challenge(s) to grow, and inspire them to achieve their dreams. His goals in teaching are not just to promote learning of the technical subject matter but also to try to help the students to learn problem-solving methods and techniques, learn to think logically, improve writing skills clearly and concisely, explain systematic processes, provide valid reasons for logical arguments etc. In addition, he provides a participative and positive environment in the classroom/ tutorial/ laboratory where students are encouraged to express their ideas/ thoughts and participate in their education/ real-life experience through the case study as much as possible.
Dr. Pachauri has been awarded as a star researcher continuously since 2021 at UPES, Dehradun, for his research contribution. He has achieved the best paper awards and handled the seed fund projects at UPES, Dehradun.
