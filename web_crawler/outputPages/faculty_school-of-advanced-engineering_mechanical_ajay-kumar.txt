Dr. Kumar has more than 22 years of experience in university-level engineering & management education and one year of industry experience. He has held many key portfolios at UPES, serving as Associate Head of Mechanical (2013-2015), Program Director-PG (2015 to 2018) and Head of Mechanical Engineering (2018 to 2021). He has also served as Program Director-PG and has rationalized many PG (M.Tech) programs, making them more consistent, efficient, and market-ready.
Research Interests
Professor Ajay's pedagogical philosophy is firmly rooted in his commitment to establishing a nurturing and motivating environment. He believes in outcome-based education (OBE) and strives to equip aspiring engineers with the skills to embark on a journey of perpetual learning and adaptability to evolving landscapes. Professor Ajay's teaching methodology integrates principles of "Project-Based Learning," a practice in which students delve into assigned topics drawn from the curriculum and supplementary resources. These topics are then presented and discussed collectively, offering a diverse array of case studies that extend beyond the foundational syllabus. This strategy effectively expands each student's knowledge horizons. Furthermore, Professor Ajay fosters an environment where students are inspired to engage in activities such as writing intellectual property rights (IPR), conceptualizing, and designing utility patents, and crafting articles. These endeavours facilitate the transition from novice-level thinking to an expert-level perspective, allowing students to progress confidently along their educational journey.
