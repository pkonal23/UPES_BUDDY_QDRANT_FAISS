Criminal Law can be generally defined as the branch of law that majorly classifies crimes and provides effective ways or approaches that can be followed for their punishment. A criminal lawyer is expected to defend clients charged with criminal offenses. This can cover a wide range of criminal offenses such as domestic violence, sex offences, drug crimes, violent crimes, theft, fraud, and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). A criminal lawyer can, of course, specialise in one area and become a drug offence solicitor, traffic lawyer, or sex offence lawyer, but in general, he must be able to handle a diverse spectrum of criminal offenses. A criminal lawyer will be required to handle bail bond hearings, trial hearings, parole and probation hearings, and present plea bargains. He must be skilled at building a case strategy and negotiate a plea bargain with the prosecution to lessen the charges.

Both parole and probation officers have very similar jobs. The main difference between the two is that probation officers work with convicted criminals who are on probation (which means they don’t have to go to prison), while parole officers work with criminals who have already been to prison. Some common tasks performed by the two involves working with criminals and creating a plan to reintegrate them in our society, helping them find a place to live, employment or treatment for mental health issues if necessary, meet the lawbreakers and administer drug tests, monitor and evaluate their overall progress.
