The duration of the program is four years, which is in line with the New Education Policy (NEP). Upon completion of the first year, students will receive a Certificate in Microbiology. After two years of study, students will be awarded a Diploma in Microbiology. At the end of the third year, students will earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology. In the fourth year, students who achieve a score of 75% and above will qualify for the "B.Sc. Honours by Research" in Microbiology. These students will be required to undertake a 15-credit research project and will have the opportunity to directly qualify for a PhD without the need for a Master's degree. Students who achieve a score below 75% will qualify for the "BSc Honors Microbiology" degree. In their final semester, they will engage in industry training or an internship, earning 15 credits. These students will then have to pursue a one-year MSc program to qualify for a PhD.
