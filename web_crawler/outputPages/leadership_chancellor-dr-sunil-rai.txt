At UPES, students are guided and motivated to practically implement the principles learnt in classrooms through experimentation in laboratories, making them confident and skilled professionals. As we strive to be at the forefront of education, we collaborate with and maintain excellent relationships with industries and leading research centres for joint projects, training, and internships. This gives our students an edge, which is reflected fully in our high placement records year after year.
A university whose top priority is to help students fulfil their aspirations and dreams. We work with students to design customised educational plans that meet their goals. Among other things, we offer our students a personalised learning environment with great flexibility and continuous mentoring. Moreover, we integrate technical knowledge with strong ethics and leadership skills to churn out the best.

We believe in the power of education to transform lives and are committed to positively impacting the communities we serve. UPES is more than just a university â€“ it has become a movement that transforms the lives of youngsters.

In the true sense, UPES is the nation-builder's university.
