Scholarly Activities
Dr. Ritesh Dubey
Assistant Professor-SG
Dr. Dubey played a vital role as a member of an international team in one of Japan's National Projects, aiming to develop a newer and more effective method for characterizing complex analytes in microgram quantities. This revolutionary method has proven highly valuable in chemical-based industries, providing opportunities to explore uncharted chemical space that was previously inaccessible due to limited analytical tools in academic and industrial research. Additionally, Dr. Dubey actively contributes as a scientific reviewer for peer-reviewed international journals, such as Crystal Growth & Design (ACS Publications), CrystEngComm (RSC Publications), and Polyhedron (Elsevier Publications).
Courses Taught
Eligibility Criteria
Dr. Dubey has taught various courses, including Contemporary Research, Challenges, and Trends (PhD; School of Engineering, >100 scholars), Pesticide Chemistry (B.Sc), and s&p-Block Elements, States of Matter, and Chemical Kinetics (B.Sc).
In recognition of his pursuit of research excellence, Dr. Dubey has received the Toulouse Medal (IISc Bangalore) and the Carl Storm International Diversity Fellowship (GRC USA).
