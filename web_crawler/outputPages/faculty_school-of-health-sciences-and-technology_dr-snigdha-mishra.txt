Dr. Snigdha Mishra
Nora C. Brown†,
Dr. Mishra considers (1) Envisioning the subject (or science here) as an actual live process and (2) individualizing one’s own learning experiences as the two most important criteria of effective learning and understanding of the subject. She has developed a new technique-based curriculum for undergraduates and graduate students to expand the existing knowledge of bio instrumentation, recombinant DNA technology, molecular biology, and advances in genetics courses.
Profile Summary
School of Health Sciences and Technology
Dr. Mishra carries expertise in the areas of Molecular Biology, Recombinant DNA Technology and Genetics; Developmental Biology; Drosophila Research in Reproductive Biology and endocrinology. She uses the tools of the powerful model system Drosophila to address questions about seminal proteins and sperm in action. Additionally, she also works on reproductive ailments where obesity serves as the underlying risk factor, employing fruit flies as the model of research.

Assistant Professor-Selection Grade
Dr. Snigdha Mishra is an avid fly researcher. While working on Drosophila melanogaster, a widely acclaimed invertebrate model for genetics, she received her Ph. D from CSIR- Indian Institute of Toxicology Research and later joined Dr. Mariana Wolfner’s fly-lab at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, to work on male derived reproductive proteins and how they modulate the physiology and behavior of females, post-transfer. She has publications in journals of international repute, including Elife, BMC Biology, PLoS Genetics, Toxicological Sciences, Scientific Reports, Phil Trans Royal Sci B, and likewise.
