As part of his participation in the Bugcrowd program, Sarthak Arora submitted a comprehensive security report for NASA's web application to NASA. The vulnerability was categorized as a "Server Security Misconfiguration" due to the absence of X-Content-Type-Options HTTP response header. This lack of the header significantly increased the web application’s exposure to MIME type sniffing, which could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Such attacks can undermine the integrity of web applications by injecting malicious scripts, potentially exposing sensitive user data.
