Teaching Philosophy
In my approach to teaching, I prioritize hands-on experience to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world industry applications. My philosophy revolves around immersing students in current technologies, avoiding traditional teaching methods, and emphasizing practical problem-solving skills.I believe in providing students with ample opportunities for hands-on experience, enabling them to directly apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios. By engaging in coding problems, SQL querying exercises, and real-world projects, students gain valuable insights into industry practices and develop the skills necessary to tackle complex challenges. Rather than relying solely on theoretical instruction, I focus on solving numerical problems and practical case studies to reinforce learning. This approach not only enhances students' understanding of fundamental concepts but also prepares them for the demands of the modern workforce.
