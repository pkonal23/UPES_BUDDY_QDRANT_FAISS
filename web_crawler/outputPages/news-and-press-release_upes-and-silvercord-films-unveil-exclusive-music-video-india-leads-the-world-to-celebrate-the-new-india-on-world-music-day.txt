We’re thrilled to share this celebration of national pride, with our fellow Indians,”

Marking World Music Day, UPES released a soulful music video to celebrate the spirit of the nation. The video is an artistic and musical expression of ‘India Leads the World and pays homage to the remarkable transformations unfolding in every aspect of India’s growth. This musical extravaganza, produced in collaboration with Silvercord Films, cherishes the work of great Indian musical maestros whose original rendition ‘Mile Sur Mera Tumhara’ struck a chord with every Indian.
When UPES approached me for this interesting collaboration, the intention, and the attempt of a homegrown piece of art inspired me to take this up. With a beautiful mix of old and new streams, we have been able to push boundaries and create something which is democratic and diverse in its nature and form
Dr. Ram K Sharma, Vice Chancellor, UPES.
