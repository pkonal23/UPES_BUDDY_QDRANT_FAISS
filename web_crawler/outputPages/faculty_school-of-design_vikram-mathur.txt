Scholarly Activities
An instructor's role extends beyond mere instruction; it's about facilitating learner comprehension and self-driven learning outcomes. The foundation of effective learning lies in establishing the necessity and significance of knowledge, which is the instructor's responsibility. Without this groundwork, true understanding remains elusive, leading to learner frustration and demotivation.
