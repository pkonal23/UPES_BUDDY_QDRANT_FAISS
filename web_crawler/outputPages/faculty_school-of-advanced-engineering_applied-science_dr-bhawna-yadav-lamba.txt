Eligibility Criteria
Dr. Bhawna joined UPES in July 2004 and has since fulfilled significant academic and non-academic responsibilities. In addition, she also convened Summer School, coordinated Project Abhilasha, designed and taught a course on "Engineering and Polymer Material for Professionals" at Finolex, served as a consultant for Nissan Technology and Maruti, actively participated in CSR activities, and served as the head of the Department of Chemistry.
Her specialization lies in biofuels and waste management, with a specific focus on enhancing the oxidation stability of biofuels for commercialization. In waste management, she works on converting municipal mixed waste plastic and medical waste (such as PPE kits) into plasto oil, an alternative to diesel fuel. Driven by her passion for sustainable solutions, she has successfully completed five externally funded research projects. Currently, she is involved in a DST_ITDD sponsored project on microalgae-mediated wastewater reclamation, aiming for bio-oil and biogas production, with a sanctioned amount of INR 73,01,360/-. Her research contributes significantly to the fields of biofuels and waste management.
