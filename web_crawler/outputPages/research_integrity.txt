UPES has a dedicated IPR cell as per the recommendations of UGC to address the awareness and importance of intellectual property along with preserving and safeguarding such intellectual property through patents and copyrights. Standard operating procedures for intellectual property creation, formulation, and filing to granting have been established. This initiative enables the faculty to work on strengthening the idea both technically and economically.
UPES aims to secure external research funding to expand its research activities and to position itself to compete for a share of the Indian government's prioritized development of a knowledge-driven economy.
UPES is dedicated to ensuring integrity in the management and execution of both external and internal projects. All members of the UPES community, including students, faculty, and staff, who are involved in projects must adhere to the highest standards of honesty, transparency, and accountability.
