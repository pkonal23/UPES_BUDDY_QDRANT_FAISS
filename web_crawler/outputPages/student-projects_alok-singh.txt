The robot senses and opens the lid for application duration and closes automatically.
The robot acts as a line follower for a predefined path when activated.

When the bin is full, it can move with its wheels following a predefined path and dispose of the litter in bigger bins at a separate location.
The lid remains closed automatically with servo motor control if there is no use to keep the surroundings clean and safe.
