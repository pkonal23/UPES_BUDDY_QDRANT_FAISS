UPES Conference Explores Tech Integration in Legal Education
Keynote Speaker, Senior Advocate Nitin Thakker, President of the Bombay Bar Association, set the tone for the event with an insightful address. He highlighted the indispensable role of technology in modern legal practice, stating, “Embracing new-age legal tech solutions demands a significant shift in mindset. We must view technology not merely as a tool but as an integral part of their education and practice. The future of legal education hinges on our ability to adapt to technology and the readiness of law schools to be dynamic with their curricula. I must congratulate and commend UPES for pioneering this initiative.”
The conference, themed ‘Adapt or Perish,’ sparked engaging discussions on the future of legal education.

Adapt or Perish
Dr. Abhishek Sinha, Dean of UPES School of Law, said, “In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, it’s imperative for all of us, especially future lawyers, to integrate tools like AI into our workflows. While legal education remains heavily theoretical, the aspiration is to shift towards a more practical approach. Despite the buzz around AI, only 22% of organisations globally have implemented it in their workflows, leaving a vast potential untapped. The legal sector must embrace these innovations to revolutionise our field in the coming years.”
The panel also emphasised the importance of fostering industry collaborations, developing robust skill sets, and adapting to our ever-evolving world to ensure future lawyers are well-equipped to thrive in an increasingly digital world.
Another panellist, Vaibhav Ganjiwale, L&D Head, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said, “We need to be innovative and inventive in using technology to make the learning process for aspiring lawyers more engaging and experiential.”
The conference also featured a dynamic panel discussion moderated by Dr. Sinha. The panel, comprising key industry leaders and academicians, discussed crucial issues such as the globalisation of legal education, curriculum changes for future readiness, the gap between the legal industry and academia in the digital era, policies for AI and tech integration in legal education.
