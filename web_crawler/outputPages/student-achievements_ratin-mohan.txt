Commenced in April 2023, and aligned with World Earth Day, the esteemed Nature Electrified Design Contest was organised by Lexus India. This competition employed a meticulous evaluation process, overseen by a distinguished jury panel. From a pool of exceptional submissions, only a handful of finalists were chosen. The selection was based on their expertise in design, the adept representation of the electrified natural theme within their creations, and their capacity to infuse ingenuity into their concepts, ultimately inspiring through the realm of imagination.
