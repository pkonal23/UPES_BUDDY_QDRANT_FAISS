Profile Summary
. Simultaneous similarity classes of commuting matrices over a finite field.
Dr. Sharma taught an introductory course to algebra called ‘Algebra-I’ in the winter semester from January to April 2023. In this topic, he introduced the basic concepts of Group Theory to the B.Sc. students at the School of Liberal Studies and Media. He also taught the Discrete Mathematics module, covering Logic and Graph Theory, as a part of the PhD. course ‘Critical Approaches to Liberal Arts’.
