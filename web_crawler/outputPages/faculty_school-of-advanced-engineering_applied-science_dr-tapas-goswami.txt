Dr. Tapas Goswami
After completing his PhD, Dr. Goswami took up a post-doctoral research position at Stanford University, CA, USA. Following that, he continued his post-doctoral research at Michigan State University, MI, USA. Prior to joining UPES, Prof. Goswami served as an Assistant Professor at Glocal University and BML Munjal University.
Dr. Goswami’s teaching philosophy is based on two ideas: (i) great teachers are those who share their passion for knowledge and inquisitiveness with their students (ii) teachers must inspire students’ creativity and develop their critical thinking ability. As a teacher my first goal is to create an atmosphere that encourages students to involve and active participation in scientific discussions. Dr. Goswami follows student-centered approach in teaching and introduces the students to hands-on learning, real-world applications and importance of theoretical chemistry concepts.
