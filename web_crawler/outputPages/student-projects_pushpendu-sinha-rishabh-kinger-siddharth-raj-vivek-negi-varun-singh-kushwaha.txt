School of Advanced Engineering
This work aims to develop Flex fuel by blending ethanol with Gasoline. Flex-fuel of four grades are prepared, namely E10, E20, E30, and E40. Blending ethanol into Gasoline in different proportions prepares these different grades of flex fuel. To prepare E10, blend 10% ethanol with 90% gasoline. E20 is prepared similarly by blending ethanol and Gasoline but in different proportions of 20%and 80%, respectively. Similarly, E30 and E40 are prepared by mixing 30% ethanol-70% gasoline and 40% ethanol-60% gasoline, respectively.
