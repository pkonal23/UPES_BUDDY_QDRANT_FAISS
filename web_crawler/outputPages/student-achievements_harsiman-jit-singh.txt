In summary, the paper addresses the pressing concern of safeguarding healthcare data from cyber threats and unauthorized access. With many medical records stored on outdated digital platforms, the vulnerability of patient data has led to frequent malicious activities that compromise patient health and financial security. Hospitals and insurance companies are particularly at risk of financial losses due to such fraudulent activities. The paper introduces a comprehensive framework that employs a verification method to ensure the security of records, aiming to counteract malicious activities. In cases where malicious actions have occurred, machine learning (ML) technology is used for detection, upholding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of Electronic Health Records (EHR). The framework's primary objective is to create a secure environment for EHR, equipping investigators with leads that can aid in recovery, recuperation, or legal action.
One of the notable research papers was presented at the 2nd International Conference on Innovative Sustainable Computational Technologies (CISCT) - #55310. The paper, titled "A Novel Multivariate Recurrent Neural Network-based Analysis Model for Predicting Stock Prices," addresses the intricate challenge of predicting stock prices due to their complex dynamics and multifactorial dependence. We explored the efficacy of recurrent neural networks (RNN) in handling such complex time series issues, employing various RNN architectures like GRU and LSTM for building multivariate models. By comparing the multivariate models with their univariate counterparts, and amongst each other, we aimed to understand how well a neural network can tackle this problem.
