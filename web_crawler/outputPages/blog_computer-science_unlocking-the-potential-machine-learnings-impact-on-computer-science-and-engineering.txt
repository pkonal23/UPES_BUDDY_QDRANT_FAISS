ML has rekindled research in the field of computer science including speech recognition, machine translation, and recommendation systems. In many areas, techniques like deep learning neural networks have demonstrated amazing performance, often exceeding human capabilities. Way back, in 2014, Jeremy Howard, in his Ted talk titled “The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn”, referred to an ML tool capable of translating in real time from English to Mandarin. Technology has in the intervening decade grown leaps and bounds, and such tools have far exceeded the capabilities of a human interpreter. Large Language Models have considerably increased machine translation systems’ accuracy, making them indispensable for international communication.
From being students at UPES School of Computer Science to becoming successful tech entrepreneurs, Divyani Singh and Anshul Saxena have achieved an incredible milestone.

Another significant contribution to the world has been Reinforcement Learning, an ML technique. It allows machines to learn through a mechanism of rewards and penalties. Agents can learn by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback. This paradigm has sparked advancements in robotics and autonomous systems, such as self-driving vehicles, drones, and robots that can carry out intricate tasks precisely while learning from their environment. It is also used in algorithmic trading to develop strategies that can make automated decisions on buying and selling financial instruments.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models, allowing computer systems to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It leverages the power of data and computational capabilities to analyse patterns, make predictions, and drive intelligent decision-making.

According to recent studies, cybercrime is expected to cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.
However, with great power comes great responsibility. The widespread adoption of ML also raises ethical and societal concerns. Bias in ML models, privacy violations, and job displacement are significant challenges that need to be addressed. Computer scientists and engineers must work hand-in-hand to develop ethical guidelines, ensure transparency, and minimise the negative impacts of ML technologies.

Machine learning has ushered in dramatic advances in the engineering profession. Devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) are now smarter and more productive thanks to the incorporation of ML algorithms. For instance, ML is used by smart home systems to optimise energy utilisation and improve sustainability. The predictive skills of ML are essential for industrial machinery predictive maintenance, assisting in reducing downtime and increasing productivity.
UPES was an associate sponsor of the Pune Design Festival, 2022. One of the workshops at the festival ‘Into the Metaverse – AR/VR’ was presented by UPES faculty Dr. Anmol Srivastava and Pankaj Badoni, who gave engaging insights about the early stages of Metaverse.
Moreover, ML plays a pivotal role in data analysis, a critical component of engineering projects. Engineers now use ML to process massive datasets generated by sensors and simulations. ML algorithms can quickly identify patterns and anomalies, assisting engineers in making informed decisions and optimising designs.
To preserve natural resources for future generations and to minimise their negative effects on the environment, conservation refers to the ethical management and sustainable use of these resources.
In recent years, the field of AI has shown impressive progress and innovation, affecting our everyday lives in unprecedented ways.
Decision-making is a ubiquitous and indispensable aspect of responsible human life.  Decisions must be made at individual and at institutional levels.
